        "title": "Antimicrobial Resistance: A Growing Serious Threat for Global Public Health",
        "abstract": "Antibiotics are among the most important discoveries of the 20th century, having saved millions of lives from infectious diseases. Microbes have developed acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to many drugs due to high selection pressure from increasing use and misuse of antibiotics over the years. The transmission and acquisition of AMR occur primarily via a human\u2013human interface both within and outside of healthcare facilities. A huge number of interdependent factors related to healthcare and agriculture govern the development of AMR through various drug-resistance mechanisms. The emergence and spread of AMR from the unrestricted use of antimicrobials in livestock feed has been a major contributing factor. The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria has attained an incongruous level worldwide and threatens global public health as a silent pandemic, necessitating urgent intervention. Therapeutic options of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are limited, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality with high financial impact. The paucity in discovery and supply of new novel antimicrobials to treat life-threatening infections by resistant pathogens stands in sharp contrast to demand. Immediate interventions to contain AMR include surveillance and monitoring, minimizing over-the-counter antibiotics and antibiotics in food animals, access to quality and affordable medicines, vaccines and diagnostics, and enforcement of legislation. An orchestrated collaborative action within and between multiple national and international organizations is required urgently, otherwise, a postantibiotic era can be a more real possibility than an apocalyptic fantasy for the 21st century. This narrative review highlights on this basis, mechanisms and factors in microbial resistance, and key strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

        "title": "The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial intelligence from a business model innovation perspective",
        "abstract": "Abstract The introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI has stimulated substantial discourse on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains such as academia, business, and society at large. Although AI has been utilized in numerous areas for several years, the emergence of generative AI (GAI) applications such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or DALL-E are considered a breakthrough for the acceleration of AI technology due to their ease of use, intuitive interface, and performance. With GAI, it is possible to create a variety of content such as texts, images, audio, code, and even videos. This creates a variety of implications for businesses requiring a deeper examination, including an influence on business model innovation (BMI). Therefore, this study provides a BMI perspective on GAI with two primary contributions: (1) The development of six comprehensive propositions outlining the impact of GAI on businesses, and (2) the discussion of three industry examples, specifically software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. This study employs a qualitative content analysis using a scoping review methodology, drawing from a wide-ranging sample of 513 data points. These include academic publications, company reports, and public information such as press releases, news articles, interviews, and podcasts. The study thus contributes to the growing academic discourse in management research concerning AI's potential impact and offers practical insights into how to utilize this technology to develop new or improve existing business models.",

        "abstract": "A biomarker is any measurable biological moiety that can be assessed and measured as a potential index of either normal or abnormal pathophysiology or pharmacological responses to some treatment regimen. Every tissue in the body has a distinct biomolecular make-up, which is known as its biomarkers, which possess particular features, viz., the levels or activities (the ability of a gene or protein to carry out a particular body function) of a gene, protein, or other biomolecules. A biomarker refers to some feature that can be objectively quantified by various biochemical samples and evaluates the exposure of an organism to normal or pathological procedures or their response to some drug interventions. An in-depth and comprehensive realization of the significance of these biomarkers becomes quite important for the efficient diagnosis of diseases and for providing the appropriate directions in case of multiple drug choices being presently available, which can benefit any patient. Presently, advancements in omics technologies have opened up new possibilities to obtain novel biomarkers of different types, employing genomic strategies, epigenetics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, lipid-based analysis, protein studies, etc. Particular biomarkers for specific diseases, their prognostic capabilities, and responses to therapeutic paradigms have been applied for screening of various normal healthy, as well as diseased, tissue or serum samples, and act as appreciable tools in pharmacology and therapeutics, etc. In this review, we have summarized various biomarker types, their classification, and monitoring and detection methods and strategies. Various analytical techniques and approaches of biomarkers have also been described along with various clinically applicable biomarker sensing techniques which have been developed in the recent past. A section has also been dedicated to the latest trends in the formulation and designing of nanotechnology-based biomarker sensing and detection developments in this field.",

While progress has been made in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer patients, individualized and data-driven care remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI), which is used to predict and automate many cancers, has emerged as a promising option for improving healthcare accuracy and patient outcomes. AI applications in oncology include risk assessment, early diagnosis, patient prognosis estimation, and treatment selection based on deep knowledge. Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from training data, has been highly effective at predicting various types of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, liver, and prostate cancer. In fact, AI and ML have demonstrated greater accuracy in predicting cancer than clinicians. These technologies also have the potential to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and quality of life of patients with various illnesses, not just cancer.

        "abstract": "The discovery of the link between microRNAs (miRNAs) and a myriad of human diseases, particularly various cancer types, has generated significant interest in exploring their potential as a novel class of drugs. This has led to substantial investments in interdisciplinary research fields such as biology, chemistry, and medical science for the development of miRNA-based therapies. Furthermore, the recent global success of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic has further revitalized interest in RNA-based immunotherapies, including miRNA-based approaches to cancer treatment. Consequently, RNA therapeutics have emerged as highly adaptable and modular options for cancer therapy. Moreover, advancements in RNA chemistry and delivery methods have been pivotal in shaping the landscape of RNA-based immunotherapy, including miRNA-based approaches. Consequently, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has witnessed a resurgence of interest in incorporating RNA-based immunotherapies and miRNA therapeutics into their development programs. Despite substantial progress in preclinical research, the field of miRNA-based therapeutics remains in its early stages, with only a few progressing to clinical development, none reaching phase III clinical trials or being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and several facing termination due to toxicity issues. These setbacks highlight existing challenges that must be addressed for the broad clinical application of miRNA-based therapeutics. Key challenges include establishing miRNA sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity towards their intended targets, mitigating immunogenic reactions and off-target effects, developing enhanced methods for targeted delivery, and determining optimal dosing for therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. Additionally, the limited understanding of the precise functions of miRNAs limits their clinical utilization. Moreover, for miRNAs to be viable for cancer treatment, they must be technically and economically feasible for the widespread adoption of RNA therapies. As a result, a thorough risk evaluation of miRNA therapeutics is crucial to minimize off-target effects, prevent overdosing, and address various other issues. Nevertheless, the therapeutic potential of miRNAs for various diseases is evident, and future investigations are essential to determine their applicability in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer that is difficult to treat due to its resistance to both radiation and chemotherapy. This resistance is largely due to the unique biology of GBM cells, which can evade the effects of conventional treatments through mechanisms such as increased resistance to cell death and rapid regeneration of cancerous cells. Additionally, the blood\u2013brain barrier makes it difficult for chemotherapy drugs to reach GBM cells, leading to reduced effectiveness. Despite these challenges, there are several treatment options available for GBM. The standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients involves surgical resection followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Emerging treatments include immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab, that attempt to attack specific vulnerabilities in GBM cells. Another promising approach is the use of tumor-treating fields, a type of electric field therapy that has been shown to slow the growth of GBM cells. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these and other innovative treatments for GBM, intending to improve with outcomes for patients.",

After the histone translation, its amino tail undergoes various modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, malonylation, propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, and lactylation, which together constitute the \u201chistone code.\u201d The relationship between their combination and biological function can be used as an important epigenetic marker. Methylation and demethylation of the same histone residue, acetylation and deacetylation, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and even methylation and acetylation between different histone residues cooperate or antagonize with each other, forming a complex network. Histone\u2010modifying enzymes, which cause numerous histone codes, have become a hot topic in the research on cancer therapeutic targets. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the role of histone post\u2010translational modifications (PTMs) in cell life activities is very important for preventing and treating human diseases. In this review, several most thoroughly studied and newly discovered histone PTMs are introduced. Furthermore, we focus on the histone\u2010modifying enzymes with carcinogenic potential, their abnormal modification sites in various tumors, and multiple essential molecular regulation mechanism. Finally, we summarize the missing areas of the current research and point out the direction of future research. We hope to provide a comprehensive understanding and promote further research in this field.",

In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges.

From an end-point perspective, the success of a microfluidic OoAC relies mainly on the type of biomaterial and the fabrication strategy employed. Certain biomaterials, such as PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), are preferred over others due to their ease of fabrication and proven success in modelling complex organ systems. However, the inherent nature of human microtissues to respond differently to surrounding stimulations has led to the combination of biomaterials ranging from simple PDMS chips to 3D-printed polymers coated with natural and synthetic materials, including hydrogels. In addition, recent advances in 3D printing and bioprinting techniques have led to the powerful combination of utilizing these materials to develop microfluidic OoAC devices. In this narrative review, we evaluate the different materials used to fabricate microfluidic OoAC devices while outlining their pros and cons in different organ systems. A note on combining the advances made in additive manufacturing (AM) techniques for the microfabrication of these complex systems is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) materials are gaining significant interest in biomedical research, owing to their high porosity, crystallinity, and structural and compositional diversity. Their versatile hybrid organic/inorganic chemistry endows MOFs with the capacity to retain organic (drug) molecules, metals, and gases, to effectively channel electrons and photons, to survive harsh physiological conditions such as low pH, and even to protect sensitive biomolecules. Extensive preclinical research has been carried out with MOFs to treat several pathologies and, recently, their integration with other biomedical materials such as stents and implants has demonstrated promising performance in regenerative medicine. However, there remains a significant gap between MOF preclinical research and translation into clinically and societally relevant medicinal products. Here, the intrinsic features of MOFs are outlined and their suitability to specific biomedical applications such as detoxification, drug and gas delivery, or as (combination) therapy platforms is discussed. Furthermore, relevant examples of how MOFs have been engineered and evaluated in different medical indications, including cancer, microbial, and inflammatory diseases is described. Finally, the challenges facing their translation into the clinic are critically examined, with the goal of establishing promising research directions and more realistic approaches that can bridge the translational gap of MOFs and MOF\u2010containing (nano)materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The clinical translations of drugs and nanomedicines depend on coherent pharmaceutical research based on biologically accurate screening approaches. Since establishing the 2D in vitro cell culture method, the scientific community has improved cell\u2010based drug screening assays and models. Those advances result in more informative biochemical assays and the development of 3D multicellular models to describe the biological complexity better and enhance the simulation of the in vivo microenvironment. Despite the overall dominance of conventional 2D and 3D cell macroscopic culture methods, they present physicochemical and operational challenges that impair the scale\u2010up of drug screening by not allowing a high parallelization, multidrug combination, and high\u2010throughput screening. Their combination and complementarity with microfluidic platforms enable the development of microfluidics\u2010based cell culture platforms with unequivocal advantages in drug screening and cell therapies. Thus, this review presents an updated and consolidated view of cell culture miniaturization's physical, chemical, and operational considerations in the pharmaceutical research scenario. It clarifies advances in the field using gradient\u2010based microfluidics, droplet\u2010based microfluidics, printed\u2010based microfluidics, digital\u2010based microfluidics, SlipChip, and paper\u2010based microfluidics.

        "abstract": "Liquid biopsies using cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are being used frequently in both research and clinical settings. ctDNA can be used to identify actionable mutations to personalize systemic therapy, detect post-treatment minimal residual disease (MRD), and predict responses to immunotherapy. ctDNA can also be isolated from a range of different biofluids, with the possibility of detecting locoregional MRD with increased sensitivity if sampling more proximally than blood plasma. However, ctDNA detection remains challenging in early-stage and post-treatment MRD settings where ctDNA levels are minuscule giving a high risk for false negative results, which is balanced with the risk of false positive results from clonal hematopoiesis. To address these challenges, researchers have developed ever-more elegant approaches to lower the limit of detection (LOD) of ctDNA assays toward the part-per-million range and boost assay sensitivity and specificity by reducing sources of low-level technical and biological noise, and by harnessing specific genomic and epigenomic features of ctDNA. In this review, we highlight a range of modern assays for ctDNA analysis, including advancements made to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We further highlight the challenge of detecting ultra-rare tumor-associated variants, overcoming which will improve the sensitivity of post-treatment MRD detection and open a new frontier of personalized adjuvant treatment decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Bioprinting, an innovative combination of biotechnology and additive manufacturing, has emerged as a transformative technology in healthcare, enabling the fabrication of functional tissues, organs, and patient-specific implants. The implementation of the aforementioned, however, introduces unique intellectual property (IP) challenges that extend beyond conventional biotechnology. The study explores three critical areas of concern: IP protection for bioprinting hardware and bioinks, ownership and ethical management of digital files derived from biological data, and the implications of commercializing bioprinted tissues and organs. Employing a multidisciplinary approach, the paper analyzes existing IP frameworks, highlights their limitations when applied to bioprinting, and examines ethical dilemmas, such as ownership of bioprinted human tissues and the commodification of biological innovations. Findings suggest that current IP laws inadequately address the complexities of bioprinting, particularly in managing the intersection of proprietary technologies and ethical considerations. The study underscores the need for adaptive legal and ethical frameworks to balance innovation with equitable access and sustainability. Recommendations include the development of tailored IP policies for bioprinting and enhanced international collaboration to harmonize legal protections across jurisdictions. This work aims to provide a comprehensive foundation for stakeholders to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of bioprinting IP.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Genome editing \u2014 a plant\u2010breeding technology that facilitates the manipulation of genetic traits within living organisms \u2014 has captured the imagination of scholars and professionals working on agricultural development in Africa. Echoing the arrival of genetically modified (GM) crops decades ago, genome editing is being heralded as a technology with the potential to revolutionize breeding based on enhanced precision, reduced cost and increased speed. This article makes two interventions. First, it identifies the discursive continuity linking genome editing and the earlier technology of genetic modification. Second, it offers a suite of recommendations regarding how lessons learned from GM crops might be integrated into future breeding programmes focused on genome editing. Ultimately, the authors argue that donors, policy makers and scientists should move beyond the genome towards systems\u2010level thinking by prioritizing the co\u2010development of technologies with farmers; using plant material that is unencumbered by intellectual property restrictions and therefore accessible to resource\u2010poor farmers; and acknowledging that seeds are components of complex and dynamic agroecological production systems. If these lessons are not heeded, genome\u2010editing projects are in danger of repeating mistakes of the past.",

        "abstract": "Transdermal drug delivery systems offer several advantages over conventional oral or hypodermic administration due to the avoidance of first-pass drug metabolism and gastrointestinal degradation as well as patients\u2019 convenience due to a minimally invasive and painless approach. A novel transdermal drug delivery system, comprising a combination of transfersomes with either solid silicon or solid polycarbonate microneedles has been developed for the transdermal delivery of aspirin. Aspirin was encapsulated inside transfersomes using a \u201cthin-film hydration sonication\u201d technique, yielding an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 67.5%. The fabricated transfersomes have been optimised and fully characterised in terms of average size distribution and uniformity, surface charge and stability (shelf-life). Transdermal delivery, enhanced by microneedle penetration, allows the superior permeation of transfersomes into perforated porcine skin and has been extensively characterised using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In vitro permeation studies revealed that transfersomes enhanced the permeability of aspirin by more than four times in comparison to the delivery of unencapsulated \u201cfree\u201d aspirin. The microneedle-assisted delivery of transfersomes encapsulating aspirin yielded 13-fold and 10-fold increases in permeation using silicon and polycarbonate microneedles, respectively, in comparison with delivery using only transfersomes. The cytotoxicity of different dose regimens of transfersomes encapsulating aspirin showed that encapsulated aspirin became cytotoxic at concentrations of \u2265100 \u03bcg/mL. The results presented demonstrate that the transfersomes could resolve the solubility issues of low-water-soluble drugs and enable their slow and controlled release. Microneedles enhance the delivery of transfersomes into deeper skin layers, providing a very effective system for the systemic delivery of drugs. This combined drug delivery system can potentially be utilised for numerous drug treatments.",

We propose that a quantitative matrix of the Cancer Biomarker Glycocode and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms will expand the menu of validated cancer biomarkers as a step to resolve some of the challenges in cancer diagnosis, and yield a combination that can identify a specific cancer, in a tissue-agnostic manner especially at early stages, to enable early intervention. Diagnosis is critical to reducing cancer mortality but many cancers lack efficient and effective diagnostic tests, especially for early stage disease. Ideal diagnostic biomarkers are etiological, samples are preferably obtained via non-invasive methods (e.g. liquid biopsy of blood or urine), and are quantitated using assays that yield high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for efficient diagnosis, prognosis, or predicting response to therapy. Validated biomarkers with these features are rare. While the advent of proteomics and genomics has led to the identification of a multitude of proteins and nucleic acid sequences as cancer biomarkers, relatively few have been approved for clinical use. The use of multiplex arrays and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms offer the option of combining data of known biomarkers; however, for most, the sensitivity and the specificity are below acceptable criteria, and clinical validation has proven difficult. One strategic solution to this problem is to expand the biomarker families beyond those currently exploited. One unexploited family of cancer biomarkers comprise glycoproteins, carbohydrates, and glycolipids (the Tumor Glycocode). Here, we focus on a family of glycolipid cancer biomarkers, the tumor-marker gangliosides (TMGs). We discuss the diagnostic potential of TMGs for detecting cancer, especially at early stages. We include prior studies from the literature to summarize findings for ganglioside quantification, expression, detection, and biological function and its role in various cancers. We highlight the examples of TMGs exhibiting ideal properties of cancer diagnostic biomarkers, and the application of GD2 and GD3 for diagnosis of early stage cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.

Some of these events are reviewed, paying special attention to immunosuppressant drugs, which are one of the most relevant milestones in the prevention of organ transplant rejection. The discovery, industrial exploitation, mechanisms of action and side effects of several drugs exhibiting immunosuppressive effects (e.g., corticosteroids, nitrogen mustards, mycophenolic acid, rapamycin) are deeply detailed. Furthermore, new trends in immunosuppressant research, improvement and reformulation are also reviewed. Nevertheless, the core of the manuscript is the immunosuppressant tacrolimus, also called FK506, which has been sought after due to the commercial success of cyclosporine and other immunosuppressant compounds, but also because of the side effects of those previous compounds. Thus, in the mid-1980s tacrolimus was described as a more potent immunosuppressive molecule, with less undesirable effects. Currently, tacrolimus is a well-stablished API that is used as a clinical treatment to avoid graft rejection, but also shows interesting properties in terms of decreasing the impact of some autoimmune diseases and acting as an enhancer of nerve regeneration treatments. Thus, in the 40th anniversary of its discovery, this paper describes the current state of the art of this drug and how it is adapting to new social needs and clinical trends.",

        "title": "Assessment of the Regulatory and Institutional Framework for Agricultural Gene Editing via CRISPR-based Technologies in Latin America and the Caribbean",
        "abstract": "Genome editing tools have promised tremendous opportunities in agriculture for breeding crops and livestock across the food supply chain. Potentially addressing issues associated with a growing global population, sustainability concerns, and possibly helping address the effects of climate change (Kuiken, Barrangou, and Grieger 2021). These promises come alongside environmental, cultural, and socio-economic risks. Including concerns that governance systems are not keeping pace with technological developments and are ill-equipped, or not well suited to evaluate risks new genome editing tools may introduce. Understanding these complex, dynamic interactions across the LAC region is important to inform appropriate and acceptable regional governance and investment strategies. The power and promise of gene editing, CRISPR specifically, were first realized with the discovery of CRISPR loci in the 1980s (Anzalone, Koblan, and Liu 2020). Since that time, CRISPR-Cas systems have been further developed enabling genome editing in virtually all organisms across the tree of life (Anzalone, Koblan, and Liu 2020). Gene editing is not a singular technology or technique; it refers most often to a set of techniques that enable the manipulation of a genome with greater precision than previous iterations of genetic engineering (Shukla-Jones, Friedrichs, and Winickoff 2018b). The Inter-American Development Bank partnered with North Carolina State Universitys Genetic Engineering and Society (GES) Center to assess the regulatory and institutional frameworks surrounding gene-editing via CRISPR-based technologies in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) regions. The project studied the following core components: Current Policy Evaluation: Understanding what the future may hold requires a critical examination of the current status of the regulatory landscape. Analysis of the existing regulatory systems for agricultural biotechnologies throughout Latin America and how they included considerations for novel biotechnology strategies such as gene editing through CRISPR technologies were done. Forecasting and Future Policy Scenario Analysis: Potential products created through gene editing may face very different situations on the ground, depending on countries diverse regulations and market structures. To clarify the potential impacts of regulatory reforms, we included concrete case studies in our analysis. Identifying investment priorities: The diversity of the region naturally means that countries will have unique priorities and needs with respect to investment in agricultural biotechnology development and regulatory infrastructure. The document evaluates the accomplishments of the region in the development of gene edited products, highlighting both private and public sector innovations.",

The pharmaceutical sector features high research and development intensity, patent-driven revenue cycles, and inelastic demand for therapies, which create opportunities and risks for investors. Under the circumstances of rising innovation costs, patent cliffs, and evolving regulatory landscapes, the study explores how fundamental analysis can identify undervalued firms with durable competitive advantages. The analysis mainly employs value investing method, integrating financial metrics, industry-specific indicators and qualitative assessments of corporate values. Merck &amp; Co., a leader in oncology and vaccines, serves as the primary case, with its financial performance, product portfolio, and risk profile. The study concludes that value investing principles are highly applicable to pharmaceuticals when adjusted for clinical trial risks patent life cycles and regulatory uncertainties. Merck exemplifies how scientific excellence and financial discipline align to create shareholder value, though investors must balance growth potential with sector-specific risks. This study offers insights for identifying undervalued assets in a high-stakes, innovation-driven market.",

India has witnessed a growing adoption of r-DNA-based therapies in diverse disease areas over the past five years. This review systematically analyzes the approval trends of r-DNA therapeutics in India between 2020 and 2024, highlights regulatory frameworks, therapeutic areas, and discusses the associated market dynamics and challenges. Approval data were obtained from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) and supplemented with information from published literature, drug databases, and industry reports. Therapeutics were categorized based on indication, origin (indigenous/imported), and product type. A total of 111 r-DNA therapeutics was approved over the five-year period, with a significant surge in 2023. Oncology constituted the leading therapeutic area (38% of total approvals), followed by diabetes, hemophilia, and osteoporosis. The majority of approvals were monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins. Despite the progress, a substantial portion of the products remain imported, highlighting gaps in local manufacturing. Conclusion: India is emerging as a significant player in r-DNA therapeutics. However, regulatory harmonization, indigenous development, cost containment, and infrastructure strengthening are essential to realize the full potential of r-DNA technology in improving public health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Five-year anniversaries are symbolized by a product of natural biotechnology: wood. This article marks the wood anniversary of the \u201cTop Ten Biotechnology Patent Cases\u201d series that began in 2018. Imagining the world in 2018 is challenging, in part because it was, indeed, a different world. There had not been a major pandemic in one hundred years. Inflation was low. The economy hummed along. No individual war appeared to threaten more than regional stability. O tempora, o mores! The year 2022 was quite different. SARS-CoV-2 continued to stalk the land, having had a monumentally mortiferous effect for several years. High inflation was rampant. The economy was still recovering from one of the deepest declines in history, with imbalances across many sectors. Moreover, eastern Europe had let slip the dogs of war, threatening peace worldwide. Biotechnology also has seen changes of significant magnitude. Venture capital investment in biotechnology was small compared to what it is now. Efficient genome editing was restricted to first-generation CRISPR-Cas9 systems, while now it may be accomplished using more powerful and accurate methods, like base editing and prime editing (the latter offering hope for treatment in almost 90% of genetic diseases). Courts had declared that diagnostic methods did not constitute patentable subject matter, which remains the case today, although clever draftswomen continue their efforts to obtain claims protecting such methods to some extent. Over the course of 2022, courts decided a generous selection of cases covering a wide variety of biotechnology patent law issues. These cases ran the gamut, from patent doctrines concerning satisfaction of the written description requirement for antibody claims to mechanisms for augmenting patent terms using either Patent Term Extension, or Patent Term Adjustment, or both. This article has chosen ten of the most important, though, as is the case every year, our choice of only ten was difficult, and, by necessity, left worthy cases on the cutting room floor.",

This study examines the indicators necessary for selecting innovation triggers that can lead country\u2019s sustainable development. Innovation trigger system is mechanism that initiates and drives the development of new technologies and processes, essential for sustainable development by facilitating the transition to more sustainable practices. However, not all innovation triggers succeed or offer long-term benefits for sustainable development. This study aims to identify the indicators necessary to select effective innovation trigger for sustainable country development. It has been described hype cycle phases of main technologies in the 21-st century, and defines that there is no one duration of hype cycle phases for AI, IoT, AR and VR, blockchain technologies. It has been proposed the innovation trigger system indicators to select beneficial innovation trigger that divided into two groups, set of lagging indicators and set of leading indicators. Lagging indicators assess the effectiveness of past strategies and investments, while leading indicators provide insights into future performance and potential outcomes. By utilizing both types of indicators, a more balanced and comprehensive analysis can be achieved when selecting the most beneficial innovation trigger for a country\u2019s development. The final choice of innovation trigger in each country will ultimately depend on its prioritized development goals. Additionally, it has been applied and modified the Bass Model to forecast the diffusion of AI among industrial enterprises in Ukraine. The basic Bass model has been extended to include a developer influence coefficient, which accounts for the role of AI developers in technology diffusion. Understanding the processes of diffusion and the effectiveness of innovation triggers, as well as the phases of the hype cycle, provides guidance for policymakers, business structures, and enterprises in technology implementation and the use of innovation for development, which determines the sustainability of national economic progress.",

Given its potential in therapeutic applications, intellectual property rights (IPR) as a protection resource of knowledge are a relevant topic. Patent eligibility of stem cells has been controversial as restrictions to access the fundamental technologies open a gap between research and clinic. Therefore, we depicted the current patent landscape in the field to discuss if this approach moves forward in closing this breach by examining patent activity over the last decade from a transdisciplinary perspective. Stem cell therapeutic applications is an area of continuous growth where patent filing through the PCT is the preferred strategy. Patenting activity is concentrated in the USA, European Union, and Australia; this accumulation in a few key players leads to governance, regulation, and inequality concerns. To boost wealthiness and welfare in society - stem cell therapies' ultimate goal - while at post-pandemic recovery, critical elements in the field of IPR rise to overcome current limitations: to promote bridge builders able to connect the research and business worlds, regulatory updates, novel financing models, new vehicles (startups, spinouts, and spin-offs), and alternative figures of intellectual property.</ns4:p>",

This review systematically analyzes the functions, practical uses, and limitations of microbially-produced plant hormones such as auxins, gibberellins, and stress-related compounds in boosting agricultural output and plant stress adaptation. We emphasize how beneficial soil microorganisms regulate plant hormonal balance to enhance growth, water efficiency, and pathogen defense in diverse crops. Cutting-edge innovations in genetic modification and nano-scale delivery systems are presented, supported by empirical evidence demonstrating significant yield improvements (15-40%). Persistent obstacles including inconsistent field results, product stability, and regulatory complexities hinder commercial scalability. The paper further investigates synergistic opportunities with smart farming technologies like sensor networks and predictive analytics.

This is especially important as they consider not only publishing their innovations but also protecting and monetizing them. Understanding issues such as freedom to operate and rights of ownership is important to maximize the impact of inventions. Understanding issues such as jurisdiction (i.e. where one can enforce their patent rights) is also critical. Timing and content of publications need to be carefully considered where researchers also wish to take advantage of patent filings.

However, incorporation of the spatial information and complex biochemical processes required in the reconstruction of CCC remains a major challenge. Here, we present COMMOT (COMMunication analysis by Optimal Transport) to infer CCC in spatial transcriptomics, which accounts for the competition between different ligand and receptor species as well as spatial distances between cells. A collective optimal transport method is developed to handle complex molecular interactions and spatial constraints. Furthermore, we introduce downstream analysis tools to infer spatial signaling directionality and genes regulated by signaling using machine learning models. We apply COMMOT to simulation data and eight spatial datasets acquired with five different technologies to show its effectiveness and robustness in identifying spatial CCC in data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages. Finally, COMMOT identifies new CCCs during skin morphogenesis in a case study of human epidermal development.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel facial expression recognition network, called Distract your Attention Network (DAN). Our method is based on two key observations in biological visual perception. Firstly, multiple facial expression classes share inherently similar underlying facial appearance, and their differences could be subtle. Secondly, facial expressions simultaneously exhibit themselves through multiple facial regions, and for recognition, a holistic approach by encoding high-order interactions among local features is required. To address these issues, this work proposes DAN with three key components: Feature Clustering Network (FCN), Multi-head Attention Network (MAN), and Attention Fusion Network (AFN). Specifically, FCN extracts robust features by adopting a large-margin learning objective to maximize class separability. In addition, MAN instantiates a number of attention heads to simultaneously attend to multiple facial areas and build attention maps on these regions. Further, AFN distracts these attentions to multiple locations before fusing the feature maps to a comprehensive one. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (including AffectNet, RAF-DB, and SFEW 2.0) verified that the proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art facial expression recognition performance. The DAN code is publicly available.",

The identification of the dystrophin gene as central to DMD pathogenesis has led to the understanding of the muscle membrane and the proteins involved in membrane stability as the focal point of the disease. The lessons learned from decades of research in human genetics, biochemistry, and physiology have culminated in establishing the myriad functionalities of dystrophin in striated muscle biology. Here, we review the pathophysiological basis of DMD and discuss recent progress toward the development of therapeutic strategies for DMD that are currently close to or are in human clinical trials. The first section of the review focuses on DMD and the mechanisms contributing to membrane instability, inflammation, and fibrosis. The second section discusses therapeutic strategies currently used to treat DMD. This includes a focus on outlining the strengths and limitations of approaches directed at correcting the genetic defect through dystrophin gene replacement, modification, repair, and/or a range of dystrophin-independent approaches. The final section highlights the different therapeutic strategies for DMD currently in clinical trials.",

Although the systemic inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection likely contributes to this increased cardiovascular risk, whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the coronary vasculature and attendant atherosclerotic plaques remains unknown. Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is detectable and replicates in coronary lesions taken at autopsy from severe COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 targeted plaque macrophages and exhibited a stronger tropism for arterial lesions than adjacent perivascular fat, correlating with macrophage infiltration levels. SARS-CoV-2 entry was increased in cholesterol-loaded primary macrophages and dependent, in part, on neuropilin-1. SARS-CoV-2 induced a robust inflammatory response in cultured macrophages and human atherosclerotic vascular explants with secretion of cytokines known to trigger cardiovascular events. Our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 infects coronary vessels, inducing plaque inflammation that could trigger acute cardiovascular complications and increase the long-term cardiovascular risk.",

        "abstract": "Chitin and chitosan are biopolymers that are frequently found in nature and have a broad range of applications in the food, biomedical and industrial sectors, due to their high biological activity. The primary source of chitin and chitosan is shellfish, however, shortages in the supply chain, seasonality issues in their availability, as well as ecological degradation are only a few of the problems with the main chitin resources. Due to the broad spectrum of applications for which chitin can be used, the demand for chitin and its derivatives is increasing. Therefore, the market is looking for widely available, greener alternatives to the main commercial chitin sources. Insects appear as a suitable candidate to fill this gap. During insect rearing and processing, a number of side streams are generated, e.g., exuviae of larvae and pupae, dead adults, etc. which are currently mostly discarded as waste. However, these side streams could constitute a novel and long-term supply of chitin for industrial applications. Recent research has demonstrated the suitability of several edible insect species for the production of chitin and chitosan, wherein the exoskeleton of the black soldier fly and field cricket are rich in chitin, making them a good source for chitin and chitosan extraction and purification among other farmed insect candidates. Moreover, several potential uses have been identified for insect-derived chitin and chitosan. Thus, this review aims to present recent advances in the production of chitin and chitosan from edible insects, specifically on their extraction and purification, as well as on their applications for agriculture, food and nutrition, biomedicine and bioplastic production.",

Existing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics-based methods primarily focus on identifying cell-type pairs for a specific interaction, while less attention has been paid to the prioritisation of interaction features or the identification of interaction spots in the spatial context. Here, we introduce SpatialDM, a statistical model and toolbox leveraging a bivariant Moran\u2019s statistic to detect spatially co-expressed ligand and receptor pairs, their local interacting spots (single-spot resolution), and communication patterns. By deriving an analytical null distribution, this method is scalable to millions of spots and shows accurate and robust performance in various simulations. On multiple datasets including melanoma, Ventricular-Subventricular Zone, and intestine, SpatialDM reveals promising communication patterns and identifies differential interactions between conditions, hence enabling the discovery of context-specific cell cooperation and signalling.",

Numerous ultrastructural studies have documented a plasma membrane invagination with a dense neck, termed the micropore, on the surface of intracellular parasites. However, the function of this structure remains unknown. Here we validate the micropore as an essential organelle for endocytosis of nutrients from the host cell cytosol and Golgi in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii . Detailed analyses demonstrated that Kelch13 is localized at the dense neck of the organelle and functions as a protein hub at the micropore for endocytic uptake. Intriguingly, maximal activity of the micropore requires the ceramide de novo synthesis pathway in the parasite. Thus, this study provides insights into the machinery underlying acquisition of host cell-derived nutrients by apicomplexan parasites that are otherwise sequestered from host cell compartments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The development of bioactive scaffolds by mimicking bone tissue extracellular matrix is promising for bone regeneration. Herein, inspired by the bone tissue composition, a novel pearl powder (PP) hybrid fish gelatin methacrylate (GelMa) hydrogel scaffold loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for bone regeneration is presented. With the help of microfluidic\u2010assisted 3D printing technology, the composition and structure of the hybrid scaffold can be accurately controlled to meet clinical requirements. The combination of fish skin GelMa and PP also endowed the hybrid scaffold with good biocompatibility, cell adhesion, and osteogenic differentiation ability. Moreover, the controlled release of VEGF enables the scaffold to promote angiogenesis. Thus, the bone regeneration in the proposed scaffolds could be accelerated under the synergic effect of osteogenesis and angiogenesis, which has been proved in the rat skull defect model. These features indicate that the PP hybrid scaffolds will be an ideal candidate for bone regeneration in clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is important for brain function and its dysfunction underlies many neuropathologies. Although cell-type specificity has been implicated in NVC, how active neural information is conveyed to the targeted arterioles in the brain remains poorly understood. Here, using two-photon focal optogenetics in the mouse cerebral cortex, we demonstrate that single glutamatergic axons dilate their innervating arterioles via synaptic-like transmission between neural\u2013arteriolar smooth muscle cell junctions (NsMJs). The presynaptic parental\u2013daughter bouton makes dual innervations on postsynaptic dendrites and on arteriolar smooth muscle cells (aSMCs), which express many types of neuromediator receptors, including a low level of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 1 ( Grin1 ). Disruption of NsMJ transmission by aSMC-specific knockout of GluN1 diminished optogenetic and whisker stimulation-caused functional hyperemia. Notably, the absence of GluN1 subunit in aSMCs reduced brain atrophy following cerebral ischemia by preventing Ca 2+ overload in aSMCs during arteriolar constriction caused by the ischemia-induced spreading depolarization. Our findings reveal that NsMJ transmission drives NVC and open up a new avenue for studying stroke.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-enclosed particles secreted by a variety of cell types. These vesicles encapsulate a diverse range of molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites, and even organelles derived from their parental cells. While EVs have emerged as crucial mediators of intercellular communication, they also hold immense potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic agents for numerous diseases. A thorough understanding of EV biogenesis is crucial for the development of EV-based diagnostic developments since the composition of EVs can reflect the health and disease status of the donor cell. Moreover, when EVs are taken up by target cells, they can exert profound effects on gene expression, signaling pathways, and cellular behavior, which makes these biomolecules enticing targets for therapeutic interventions. Yet, despite decades of research, the intricate processes underlying EV biogenesis by donor cells and subsequent uptake by recipient cells remain poorly understood. In this review, we aim to summarize current insights and advancements in the biogenesis and uptake mechanisms of EVs. By shedding light on the fundamental mechanisms governing EV biogenesis and delivery, this review underscores the potential of basic mechanistic research to pave the way for developing novel diagnostic strategies and therapeutic applications.",

The genome is shaped by ancient whole-genome duplications and recurrent LTR retrotransposon bursts. Comparative genomic analyses reveal key genes involved in reproductive organ development, cell wall biosynthesis and seed storage. Two genes encoding a C 18 \u0394 9 -elongase and a C 20 \u0394 5 -desaturase are identified to be responsible for sciadonic acid biosynthesis and both are present in diverse plant lineages except angiosperms. We demonstrate that the histidine-rich boxes of the \u0394 5 -desaturase are crucial for its catalytic activity. Methylome analysis reveals that methylation valleys of the T. grandis seed genome harbor genes associated with important seed activities, including cell wall and lipid biosynthesis. Moreover, seed development is accompanied by DNA methylation changes that possibly fuel energy production. This study provides important genomic resources and elucidates the evolutionary mechanism of sciadonic acid biosynthesis in land plants.",

Additionally, we review the regulatory functions of other families, such as ERF, bHLH, bZIP, and MYB. Unraveling the mechanisms of leaf senescence regulated by TFs has the potential to improve crop yield and quality through molecular breeding.

        "abstract": "Abstract Ex vivo gene editing in T cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) holds promise for treating diseases. Gene editing encompasses the delivery of a programmable editor RNA or ribonucleoprotein, often achieved ex vivo via electroporation, and when aiming for homology-driven correction of a DNA template, often provided by viral vectors together with a nuclease editor. Although HSPCs activate a robust p53-dependent DNA damage response upon nuclease-based editing, the responses triggered in T cells remain poorly characterized. Here, we performed comprehensive multiomics analyses and found that electroporation is the main culprit of cytotoxicity in T cells, causing death and cell cycle delay, perturbing metabolism, and inducing an inflammatory response. Nuclease RNA delivery using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) nearly abolished cell death and ameliorated cell growth, improving tolerance to the procedure and yielding a higher number of edited cells compared with using electroporation. Transient transcriptomic changes upon LNP treatment were mostly caused by cellular loading with exogenous cholesterol, whose potentially detrimental impact could be overcome by limiting exposure. Notably, LNP-based HSPC editing dampened p53 pathway induction and supported higher clonogenic activity and similar or higher reconstitution by long-term repopulating HSPCs compared with electroporation, reaching comparable editing efficiencies. Overall, LNPs may allow efficient and harmless ex vivo gene editing in hematopoietic cells for the treatment of human diseases.",

As this field of study has grown, there have been significant contributions to science, technology, and industry, highlighting the value of fungi in the modern era. This paper looks at the current research, along with the existing limitations, and suggests future areas where scientists can focus their efforts, in the field mycology. We show how fungi have become important emerging diseases in medical mycology. We discuss current trends and the potential of fungi in drug and novel compound discovery. We explore the current trends in phylogenomics, its potential, and outcomes and address the question of how phylogenomics can be applied in fungal ecology. In addition, the trends in functional genomics studies of fungi are discussed with their importance in unravelling the intricate mechanisms underlying fungal behaviour, interactions, and adaptations, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of fungal biology. We look at the current research in building materials, how they can be used as carbon sinks, and how fungi can be used in biocircular economies. The numbers of fungi have always been of great interest and have often been written about and estimates have varied greatly. Thus, we discuss current trends and future research needs in order to obtain more reliable estimates. We address the aspects of machine learning (AI) and how it can be used in mycological research. Plant pathogens are affecting food production systems on a global scale, and as such, we look at the current trends and future research needed in this area, particularly in disease detection. We look at the latest data from High Throughput Sequencing studies and question if we are still gaining new knowledge at the same rate as before. A review of current trends in nanotechnology is provided and its future potential is addressed. The importance of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi is addressed and future trends are acknowledged. Fungal databases are becoming more and more important, and we therefore provide a review of the current major databases. Edible and medicinal fungi have a huge potential as food and medicines, especially in Asia and their prospects are discussed. Lifestyle changes in fungi (e.g., from endophytes, to pathogens, and/or saprobes) are also extremely important and a current research trend and are therefore addressed in this special issue of Fungal Diversity.",

This trend aligns with the increasing demand for sustainable materials, which will contribute both to an improvement in wellbeing and an extension of human life, and with the demand to keep up with advances in medical technology. In recent years, due to the diversity of their physical and biological properties and the possibility of tuning them according to the desired goal, these nanomaterials represent a point of maximum interest in the medical field. Applications such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound dressing, medical implants or those in cardiovascular health are some of the applications in which NCs have been successfully used. This review presents insight into the latest medical applications of NCs, in the forms of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), with an emphasis on the domains that have recently experienced remarkable growth, namely wound dressing, tissue engineering and drug delivery. In order to highlight only the most recent achievements, the presented information is focused on studies from the last 3 years. Approaches to the preparation of NCs are discussed either by top-down (chemical or mechanical degradation) or by bottom-up (biosynthesis) techniques, along with their morphological characterization and unique properties, such as mechanical and biological properties. Finally, the main challenges, limitations and future research directions of NCs are identified in a sustained effort to identify their effective use in biomedical fields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Current biomedical models fail to replicate the complexity of human biology. Consequently, almost 90% of drug candidates fail during clinical trials after decades of research and billions of investments in drug development. Despite their physiological similarities, animal models often misrepresent human responses, and instead, trigger ethical and societal debates regarding their use. The overall aim across regulatory entities worldwide is to replace, reduce, and refine the use of animal experimentation, a concept known as the Three Rs principle. In response, researchers develop experimental alternatives to improve the biological relevance of in vitro models through interdisciplinary approaches. This article highlights the emerging organ\u2010on\u2010a\u2010chip technologies, also known as microphysiological systems, with a focus on models of the vasculature. The cardiovascular system transports all necessary substances, including drugs, throughout the body while in charge of thermal regulation and communication between other organ systems. In addition, we discuss the benefits, limitations, and challenges in the widespread use of new biomedical models. Coupled with patient\u2010derived induced pluripotent stem cells, organ\u2010on\u2010a\u2010chip technologies are the future of drug discovery, development, and personalized medicine.",

This systematic review examines the potential of Chat GPT in diagnosing and treating patients and its contributions to medical research. Methods In order to locate articles on ChatGPT\u2019s use in clinical practise and medical research, this systematic review used PRISMA standards and conducted database searches across several sources. Selected records were analysed using ChatGPT, which also produced a summary for each article. The resultant word document was transformed to a PDF and handled using ChatPDF. The review looked at topics pertaining to scholarly publishing, clinical practise, and medical research. Results We reviewed 118 publications. There are difficulties and moral conundrums associated with using ChatGPT in therapeutic settings and medical research. Patient inquiries, note writing, decision-making, trial enrolment, data management, decision support, research support, and patient education are all things that ChatGPT can help with. However, the solutions it provides are frequently inadequate and inconsistent, presenting issues with its originality, privacy, accuracy, bias, and legality. When utilising ChatGPT for academic writings, there are issues with prejudice and plagiarism, and because it lacks human-like characteristics, its authority as an author is called into question. Conclusions ChatGPT has limitations when used in research and healthcare. Even while it aids in patient treatment, concerns regarding accuracy, authorship, and bias arise. Currently, ChatGPT can serve as a \u201cclinical assistant\u201d and be a huge assistance with research and scholarly writing.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, 3D-printed biomaterials have gained widespread usage in the manufacturing of orthopaedic implants. 3D-printed implants have low weight, minimal material waste, ease of creation, the capacity to create complex topological implants that are patient specific, and a porous structure that permits tissue development. 3D printing has the potential to reduce material waste, cut transportation costs, optimise manufacturing costs, streamline the supply chain in supply chain management (SCM), and enhance environmental sustainability by utilising the concept of production-on-demand (POD). Biopolymer-based composites consisting of cellulose, chitin, and chitosan are sustainable materials that may be utilised as necessary. In light of the present biomedical issues, hydroxyapatite and starch combinations have immense potential for generating sustainable biomaterials. Carbon, which is a key category of sustainable biomaterials, is found in a wide range of carbonaceous gels and biomaterials based on cellulose fibres and carbon nanotube. The goal of this article is to give a thorough review of a few of the most recent developments, uses, and challenges for biomaterials made from sustainable resources. In this article, the authors have initially covered different biomaterials such as metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and composite and their properties and applications. Sustainable manufacturing techniques for biomaterials such as 3D and 4D printing are also covered in this article. Different sustainable biomaterials are covered with their properties and applications such as protein-based, cellulose, chitin, and chitosan composite-based, hydroxyapatite-starch-based and carbonaceous biomaterials. At last, future scope and opportunities in sustainable biomaterials and manufacturing techniques are covered. It has been found out that 3D printing technologies may support circular production systems across a range of sectors including biomedical by permitting the use of recycled and recovered materials as raw materials only when necessary.",

Developing suitable materials for bioelectronic devices to be used for real\u2010time recording and data digitalizing has three important necessitates which should be covered. Biocompatibility, electrical conductivity, and having mechanical properties similar to soft brain tissue to decrease mechanical mismatch should be adopted for all materials. In this review, inorganic nanoparticles and intrinsically conducting polymers are discussed to impart electrical conductivity to systems, where soft materials such as hydrogels can offer reliable mechanical properties and a biocompatible substrate. Interpenetrating hydrogel networks offer more mechanical stability and provide a path for incorporating polymers with desired properties into one strong network. Promising fabrication methods, like electrospinning and additive manufacturing, allow scientists to customize designs for each application and reach the maximum potential for the system. In the near future, it is desired to fabricate biohybrid conducting polymer\u2010based interfaces loaded with cells, giving the opportunity for simultaneous stimulation and regeneration.

        "abstract": "Abstract Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodological development in a broad range of domains. In this rapidly evolving field, large number of methods are being reported using machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Majority of these models are inherently complex and lacks explanations of the decision making process causing these models to be termed as 'Black-Box'. One of the major bottlenecks to adopt such models in mission-critical application domains, such as banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and public services and safety, is the difficulty in interpreting them. Due to the rapid proleferation of these AI models, explaining their learning and decision making process are getting harder which require transparency and easy predictability. Aiming to collate the current state-of-the-art in interpreting the black-box models, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the explainable AI (XAI) models. To reduce false negative and false positive outcomes of these back-box models, finding flaws in them is still difficult and inefficient. In this paper, the development of XAI is reviewed meticulously through careful selection and analysis of the current state-of-the-art of XAI research. It also provides a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the XAI frameworks and their efficacy to serve as a starting point of XAI for applied and theoretical researchers. Towards the end, it highlights emerging and critical issues pertaining to XAI research to showcase major, model-specific trends for better explanation, enhanced transparency, and improved prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Computer-aided drug discovery has been around for decades, although the past few years have seen a tectonic shift towards embracing computational technologies in both academia and pharma. This shift is largely defined by the flood of data on ligand properties and binding to therapeutic targets and their 3D structures, abundant computing capacities and the advent of on-demand virtual libraries of drug-like small molecules in their billions. Taking full advantage of these resources requires fast computational methods for effective ligand screening. This includes structure-based virtual screening of gigascale chemical spaces, further facilitated by fast iterative screening approaches. Highly synergistic are developments in deep learning predictions of ligand properties and target activities in lieu of receptor structure. Here we review recent advances in ligand discovery technologies, their potential for reshaping the whole process of drug discovery and development, as well as the challenges they encounter.

        "abstract": "Abstract The use of nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize the detection and treatment of cancer. Developments in protein engineering and materials science have led to the emergence of new nanoscale targeting techniques, which offer renewed hope for cancer patients. While several nanocarriers for medicinal purposes have been approved for human trials, only a few have been authorized for clinical use in targeting cancer cells. In this review, we analyze some of the authorized formulations and discuss the challenges of translating findings from the lab to the clinic. This study highlights the various nanocarriers and compounds that can be used for selective tumor targeting and the inherent difficulties in cancer therapy. Nanotechnology provides a promising platform for improving cancer detection and treatment in the future, but further research is needed to overcome the current limitations in clinical translation.

        "abstract": "Antibiotics have revolutionized medicine, saving countless lives since their discovery in the early 20th century. However, the origin of antibiotics is now overshadowed by the alarming rise in antibiotic resistance. This global crisis stems from the relentless adaptability of microorganisms, driven by misuse and overuse of antibiotics. This article explores the origin of antibiotics and the subsequent emergence of antibiotic resistance. It delves into the mechanisms employed by bacteria to develop resistance, highlighting the dire consequences of drug resistance, including compromised patient care, increased mortality rates, and escalating healthcare costs. The article elucidates the latest strategies against drug-resistant microorganisms, encompassing innovative approaches such as phage therapy, CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and the exploration of natural compounds. Moreover, it examines the profound impact of antibiotic resistance on drug development, rendering the pursuit of new antibiotics economically challenging. The limitations and challenges in developing novel antibiotics are discussed, along with hurdles in the regulatory process that hinder progress in this critical field. Proposals for modifying the regulatory process to facilitate antibiotic development are presented. The withdrawal of major pharmaceutical firms from antibiotic research is examined, along with potential strategies to re-engage their interest. The article also outlines initiatives to overcome economic challenges and incentivize antibiotic development, emphasizing international collaborations and partnerships. Finally, the article sheds light on government-led initiatives against antibiotic resistance, with a specific focus on the Middle East. It discusses the proactive measures taken by governments in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to combat this global threat. In the face of antibiotic resistance, a multifaceted approach is imperative. This article provides valuable insights into the complex landscape of antibiotic development, regulatory challenges, and collaborative efforts required to ensure a future where antibiotics remain effective tools in safeguarding public health.",

This study is based on a general literature review uncovering the role of AI in healthcare and focuses on the following key aspects: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics, (ii) virtual patient care, (iii) medical research and drug discovery, (iv) patient engagement and compliance, (v) rehabilitation, and (vi) other administrative applications. The impact of AI is observed in detecting clinical conditions in medical imaging and diagnostic services, controlling the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with early diagnosis, providing virtual patient care using AI-powered tools, managing electronic health records, augmenting patient engagement and compliance with the treatment plan, reducing the administrative workload of healthcare professionals (HCPs), discovering new drugs and vaccines, spotting medical prescription errors, extensive data storage and analysis, and technology-assisted rehabilitation. Nevertheless, this science pitch meets several technical, ethical, and social challenges, including privacy, safety, the right to decide and try, costs, information and consent, access, and efficacy, while integrating AI into healthcare. The governance of AI applications is crucial for patient safety and accountability and for raising HCPs\u2019 belief in enhancing acceptance and boosting significant health consequences. Effective governance is a prerequisite to precisely address regulatory, ethical, and trust issues while advancing the acceptance and implementation of AI. Since COVID-19 hit the global health system, the concept of AI has created a revolution in healthcare, and such an uprising could be another step forward to meet future healthcare needs.",

In parallel with our history of civilization, interest in scientific approaches to unravel mechanisms underlying natural phenomena has been developing. Recent years have witnessed unprecedented growth in research in the area of pharmaceuticals and medicine. The optimism that nanotechnology (NT) applied to medicine and drugs is taking serious steps to bring about significant advances in diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease\u2014a shift from fantasy to reality. The growing interest in the future medical applications of NT leads to the emergence of a new field for nanomaterials (NMs) and biomedicine. In recent years, NMs have emerged as essential game players in modern medicine, with clinical applications ranging from contrast agents in imaging to carriers for drug and gene delivery into tumors. Indeed, there are instances where nanoparticles (NPs) enable analyses and therapies that cannot be performed otherwise. However, NPs also bring unique environmental and societal challenges, particularly concerning toxicity. Thus, clinical applications of NPs should be revisited, and a deep understanding of the effects of NPs from the pathophysiologic basis of a disease may bring more sophisticated diagnostic opportunities and yield more effective therapies and preventive features. Correspondingly, this review highlights the significant contributions of NPs to modern medicine and drug delivery systems. This study also attempted to glimpse the future impact of NT in medicine and pharmaceuticals.",

This raises, therefore, the commercial interest in MOFs which brings the necessity to decrease the cost of their production, calling for the synthesis optimization from small\u2010scale to large\u2010scale. However, the commercial availability, yet very limited, is highly dependent on their production cost. Thus, to promote the commercial development and availability of MOFs, many steps can be taken. In this work, the state\u2010of\u2010art of the large\u2010scale production of MOFs can be first outlined, before discussing the criteria of greener MOF synthesis processes. Besides, a critical evaluation of the available synthesis routes for large\u2010scale production can be given, taking into consideration their cost, environmental impact, safety, and feasibility. Moreover, since there are strong limitations to the use in the powder form, the shaping procedures can thus be discussed briefly to outline the prospects of MOFs for different industrial applications. Finally, yet importantly, the perspective for MOFs commercialization can be highlighted with an emphasis on the necessity of techno\u2010economic analyses and life\u2010cycle assessments.",

This review outlines the commonly used natural polymer in hydrogel preparation, including cellulose, chitosan, collagen/gelatin, alginate, hyaluronic acid, starch, guar gum, agarose, and dextran. The polymeric structure and process/synthesis of natural polymers are illustrated, and natural polymer-based hydrogels including the hydrogel formation and properties are elaborated. Subsequently, the biomedical applications of hydrogels based on natural polymer in drug delivery, tissue regeneration, wound healing, and other biomedical fields are summarized. Finally, the future perspectives of natural polymers and hydrogels based on them are discussed. For natural polymers, novel technologies such as enzymatic and biological methods have been developed to improve their structural properties, and the development of new natural-based polymers or natural polymer derivatives with high performance is still very important and challenging. For natural polymer-based hydrogels, novel hydrogel materials, like double-network hydrogel, multifunctional composite hydrogels, and hydrogel microrobots have been designed to meet the advanced requirements in biomedical applications, and new strategies such as dual-cross-linking, microfluidic chip, micropatterning, and 3D/4D bioprinting have been explored to fabricate advanced hydrogel materials with designed properties for biomedical applications.

Cancer therapy has always been challenging, apart from major advances in immunotherapies, stem cell transplantation, targeted therapies, hormonal therapies, precision medicine, and palliative care, and traditional therapies such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Natural products are integral to the development of innovative anticancer drugs in cancer research, offering the scientific community the possibility of exploring novel natural compounds against cancers. The role of natural products like Vincristine and Vinblastine has been thoroughly implicated in the management of leukemia and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. The computational method is the initial key approach in drug discovery, among various approaches. This review investigates the synergy between natural products and computational techniques, and highlights their significance in the drug discovery process. The transition from computational to experimental validation has been highlighted through in vitro and in vivo studies, with examples such as betulinic acid and withaferin A. The path toward therapeutic applications have been demonstrated through clinical studies of compounds such as silvestrol and artemisinin, from preclinical investigations to clinical trials. This article also addresses the challenges and limitations in the development of natural products as potential anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, the integration of deep learning and artificial intelligence with traditional computational drug discovery methods may be useful for enhancing the anticancer potential of natural products.",

        "title": "Organoid intelligence (OI): the new frontier in biocomputing and intelligence-in-a-dish",
        "abstract": "Recent advances in human stem cell-derived brain organoids promise to replicate critical molecular and cellular aspects of learning and memory and possibly aspects of cognition in vitro . Coining the term \u201corganoid intelligence\u201d (OI) to encompass these developments, we present a collaborative program to implement the vision of a multidisciplinary field of OI. This aims to establish OI as a form of genuine biological computing that harnesses brain organoids using scientific and bioengineering advances in an ethically responsible manner. Standardized, 3D, myelinated brain organoids can now be produced with high cell density and enriched levels of glial cells and gene expression critical for learning. Integrated microfluidic perfusion systems can support scalable and durable culturing, and spatiotemporal chemical signaling. Novel 3D microelectrode arrays permit high-resolution spatiotemporal electrophysiological signaling and recording to explore the capacity of brain organoids to recapitulate the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory formation and, ultimately, their computational potential. Technologies that could enable novel biocomputing models via stimulus-response training and organoid-computer interfaces are in development. We envisage complex, networked interfaces whereby brain organoids are connected with real-world sensors and output devices, and ultimately with each other and with sensory organ organoids (e.g. retinal organoids), and are trained using biofeedback, big-data warehousing, and machine learning methods. In parallel, we emphasize an embedded ethics approach to analyze the ethical aspects raised by OI research in an iterative, collaborative manner involving all relevant stakeholders. The many possible applications of this research urge the strategic development of OI as a scientific discipline. We anticipate OI-based biocomputing systems to allow faster decision-making, continuous learning during tasks, and greater energy and data efficiency. Furthermore, the development of \u201cintelligence-in-a-dish\u201d could help elucidate the pathophysiology of devastating developmental and degenerative diseases (such as dementia), potentially aiding the identification of novel therapeutic approaches to address major global unmet needs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Photodynamic therapy is an alternative treatment mainly for cancer but also for bacterial infections. This treatment dates back to 1900 when a German medical school graduate Oscar Raab found a photodynamic effect while doing research for his doctoral dissertation with Professor Hermann von Tappeiner. Unexpectedly, Raab revealed that the toxicity of acridine on paramecium depends on the intensity of light in his laboratory. Photodynamic therapy is therefore based on the administration of a photosensitizer with subsequent light irradiation within the absorption maxima of this substance followed by reactive oxygen species formation and finally cell death. Although this treatment is not a novelty, there is an endeavor for various modifications to the therapy. For example, selectivity and efficiency of the photosensitizer, as well as irradiation with various types of light sources are still being modified to improve final results of the photodynamic therapy. The main aim of this review is to summarize anticancer and antibacterial modifications, namely various compounds, approaches, and techniques, to enhance the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract RAS-driven cancers comprise up to 30% of human cancers. RMC-6236 is a RAS(ON) multi-selective noncovalent inhibitor of the active, GTP-bound state of both mutant and wild-type variants of canonical RAS isoforms with broad therapeutic potential for the aforementioned unmet medical need. RMC-6236 exhibited potent anticancer activity across RAS-addicted cell lines, particularly those harboring mutations at codon 12 of KRAS. Notably, oral administration of RMC-6236 was tolerated in vivo and drove profound tumor regressions across multiple tumor types in a mouse clinical trial with KRASG12X xenograft models. Translational PK/efficacy and PK/PD modeling predicted that daily doses of 100 mg and 300 mg would achieve tumor control and objective responses, respectively, in patients with RAS-driven tumors. Consistent with this, we describe here objective responses in two patients (at 300 mg daily) with advanced KRASG12X lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, respectively, demonstrating the initial activity of RMC-6236 in an ongoing phase I/Ib clinical trial (NCT05379985). Significance: The discovery of RMC-6236 enables the first-ever therapeutic evaluation of targeted and concurrent inhibition of canonical mutant and wild-type RAS-GTP in RAS-driven cancers. We demonstrate that broad-spectrum RAS-GTP inhibition is tolerable at exposures that induce profound tumor regressions in preclinical models of, and in patients with, such tumors.",

        "abstract": "Peptides are at the cutting edge of contemporary research for new potent, selective, and safe therapeutical agents. Their rise has reshaped the pharmaceutical landscape, providing solutions to challenges that traditional small molecules often cannot address. A wide variety of natural and modified peptides have been obtained and studied, and many others are advancing in clinical trials, covering multiple therapeutic areas. As the demand for peptide-based therapies grows, so does the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis methods. Traditional peptide synthesis, while effective, often involves environmentally draining processes, generating significant waste and consuming vast resources. The integration of green chemistry offers sustainable alternatives, prioritizing eco-friendly processes, waste reduction, and energy conservation. This review delves into the transformative potential of applying green chemistry principles to peptide synthesis by discussing relevant examples of the application of such approaches to the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with a peptide structure and how these efforts are critical for an effective green transition era in the pharmaceutical field.",

Immunomodulation has attracted much attention because it offers direct applications in both basic research and clinical therapy. Modulation of a non-adequate, amplified immune response enables to attenuate the clinical course of a disease and restore homeostasis. The potential targets to modulate immunity are as multiple as the components of the immune system, thus creating various possibilities for intervention. However, immunomodulation faces new challenges to design safer and more efficacious therapeutic compounds. This review offers a cross-sectional picture of the currently used and newest pharmacological interventions, genomic editing, and tools for regenerative medicine involving immunomodulation. We reviewed currently available experimental and clinical evidence to prove the efficiency, safety, and feasibility of immunomodulation in vitro and in vivo . We also reviewed the advantages and limitations of the described techniques. Despite its limitations, immunomodulation is considered as therapy itself or as an adjunct with promising results and developing potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract High rates of failure, exorbitant costs, and the sluggish pace of new drug discovery and development have led to a growing interest in repurposing \u201cold\u201d drugs to treat both common and rare diseases, particularly cancer. Cancer, a complex and heterogeneous disease, often necessitates a combination of different treatment modalities to achieve optimal outcomes. The intrinsic polygenicity of cancer, intricate biological signalling networks, and feedback loops make the inhibition of a single target frequently insufficient for achieving the desired therapeutic impact. As a result, addressing these complex or \u201csmart\u201d malignancies demands equally sophisticated treatment strategies. Combinatory treatments that target the multifaceted oncogenic signalling network hold immense promise. Repurposed drugs offer a potential solution to this challenge, harnessing known compounds for new indications. By avoiding the prohibitive costs and long development timelines associated with novel cancer drugs, this approach holds the potential to usher in more effective, efficient, and cost-effective cancer treatments. The pursuit of combinatory therapies through drug repurposing may hold the key to achieving superior outcomes for cancer patients. However, drug repurposing faces significant commercial, technological and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed. This review explores the diverse approaches employed in drug repurposing, delves into the challenges faced by the drug repurposing community, and presents innovative solutions to overcome these obstacles. By emphasising the significance of combinatory treatments within the context of drug repurposing, we aim to unlock the full potential of this approach for enhancing cancer therapy.",

As the field of fluorescence-based cytomics matured, it reached a technological barrier at around 30 parameter analyses, which stalled the field until spectral flow cytometry created a fundamental transformation that will likely lead to the potential of 100 simultaneous parameter analyses within a few years. The simultaneous advance in informatics has now become a watershed moment for the field as it competes with mature systematic approaches such as genomics and proteomics, allowing cytomics to take a seat at the multi-omics table. In addition, recent technological advances try to combine the speed of flow systems with other detection methods, in addition to fluorescence alone, which will make flow-based instruments even more indispensable in any biological laboratory. This paper outlines current approaches in cell analysis and detection methods, discusses traditional and microfluidic sorting approaches as well as next-generation instruments, and provides an early look at future opportunities that are likely to arise.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule that has a central role in signaling pathways involved in numerous physiological processes (e.g., vasodilation, neurotransmission, inflammation, apoptosis, and tumor growth). Due to its gaseous form, NO has a short half\u2010life, and its physiology role is concentration dependent, often restricting its function to a target site. Providing NO from an external source is beneficial in promoting cellular functions and treatment of different pathological conditions. Hence, the multifaceted role of NO in physiology and pathology has garnered massive interest in developing strategies to deliver exogenous NO for the treatment of various regenerative and biomedical complexities. NO\u2010releasing platforms or donors capable of delivering NO in a controlled and sustained manner to target tissues or organs have advanced in the past few decades. This review article discusses in detail the generation of NO via the enzymatic functions of NO synthase as well as from NO donors and the multiple biological and pathological processes that NO modulates. The methods for incorporating of NO donors into diverse biomaterials including physical, chemical, or supramolecular techniques are summarized. Then, these NO\u2010releasing platforms are highlighted in terms of advancing treatment strategies for various medical problems.",

        "title": "Metaverse in Healthcare Integrated with Explainable AI and Blockchain: Enabling Immersiveness, Ensuring Trust, and Providing Patient Data Security",
        "abstract": "Digitization and automation have always had an immense impact on healthcare. It embraces every new and advanced technology. Recently the world has witnessed the prominence of the metaverse which is an emerging technology in digital space. The metaverse has huge potential to provide a plethora of health services seamlessly to patients and medical professionals with an immersive experience. This paper proposes the amalgamation of artificial intelligence and blockchain in the metaverse to provide better, faster, and more secure healthcare facilities in digital space with a realistic experience. Our proposed architecture can be summarized as follows. It consists of three environments, namely the doctor\u2019s environment, the patient\u2019s environment, and the metaverse environment. The doctors and patients interact in a metaverse environment assisted by blockchain technology which ensures the safety, security, and privacy of data. The metaverse environment is the main part of our proposed architecture. The doctors, patients, and nurses enter this environment by registering on the blockchain and they are represented by avatars in the metaverse environment. All the consultation activities between the doctor and the patient will be recorded and the data, i.e., images, speech, text, videos, clinical data, etc., will be gathered, transferred, and stored on the blockchain. These data are used for disease prediction and diagnosis by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models. The GradCAM and LIME approaches of XAI provide logical reasoning for the prediction of diseases and ensure trust, explainability, interpretability, and transparency regarding the diagnosis and prediction of diseases. Blockchain technology provides data security for patients while enabling transparency, traceability, and immutability regarding their data. These features of blockchain ensure trust among the patients regarding their data. Consequently, this proposed architecture ensures transparency and trust regarding both the diagnosis of diseases and the data security of the patient. We also explored the building block technologies of the metaverse. Furthermore, we also investigated the advantages and challenges of a metaverse in healthcare.",

        "title": "Patient navigation across the cancer care continuum: An overview of systematic reviews and emerging literature",
        "abstract": "Abstract Patient navigation is a strategy for overcoming barriers to reduce disparities and to improve access and outcomes. The aim of this umbrella review was to identify, critically appraise, synthesize, and present the best available evidence to inform policy and planning regarding patient navigation across the cancer continuum. Systematic reviews examining navigation in cancer care were identified in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Epistemonikos, and Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) databases and in the gray literature from January 1, 2012, to April 19, 2022. Data were screened, extracted, and appraised independently by two authors. The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Review and Research Syntheses was used for quality appraisal. Emerging literature up to May 25, 2022, was also explored to capture primary research published beyond the coverage of included systematic reviews. Of the 2062 unique records identified, 61 systematic reviews were included. Fifty\u2010four reviews were quantitative or mixed\u2010methods reviews, reporting on the effectiveness of cancer patient navigation, including 12 reviews reporting costs or cost\u2010effectiveness outcomes. Seven qualitative reviews explored navigation needs, barriers, and experiences. In addition, 53 primary studies published since 2021 were included. Patient navigation is effective in improving participation in cancer screening and reducing the time from screening to diagnosis and from diagnosis to treatment initiation. Emerging evidence suggests that patient navigation improves quality of life and patient satisfaction with care in the survivorship phase and reduces hospital readmission in the active treatment and survivorship care phases. Palliative care data were extremely limited. Economic evaluations from the United States suggest the potential cost\u2010effectiveness of navigation in screening programs.",

        "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Natural products have proven to have significant curative effects and are increasingly considered as potential candidates for clinical prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Compared with synthetic drugs, natural products not only have diverse structures but also exhibit a range of biological activities against different disease states and molecular targets, making them attractive for development in the field of medicine. Despite advancements in the use of natural products for clinical purposes, there remain obstacles that hinder their full potential. These challenges include issues such as limited solubility and stability when administered orally, as well as short durations of effectiveness. To address these concerns, nano-drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising solution to overcome the barriers faced in the clinical application of natural products. These systems offer notable advantages, such as a large specific surface area, enhanced targeting capabilities, and the ability to achieve sustained and controlled release. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have provided further evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle-based systems in delivering natural products in preclinical disease models. This review describes the limitations of natural product applications and the current status of natural products combined with nanotechnology. The latest advances in nano-drug delivery systems for delivery of natural products are considered from three aspects: connecting targeting warheads, self-assembly, and co-delivery. Finally, the challenges faced in the clinical translation of nano-drugs are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Good water quality in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is crucial for ensuring the successful growth and survival of reared species. So far, there are no regulations for which parameters should be measured in RAS, and each farmer decides which parameters to follow. Traditionally, water quality parameters have been measured at certain intervals with handheld sensors and laboratory analyses, which can be labour intensive. Currently, a variety of sensors and monitoring equipment is available, even for the real\u2010time monitoring of water quality parameters. Internet of Things\u2010based systems and artificial intelligence can be applied for the monitoring purposes which allows real\u2010time measurements and warnings of critical situations. However, many of the modern systems need competent users and require regular maintenance and calibration. Changes in water quality also induces changes in fish behaviour, such as swimming activity, depth, acceleration and water quality can be assessed also based on these changes. In this review, water quality parameters, variety of sensors and monitoring technologies have been summarised to provide an overview of the current monitoring systems for water quality. Additionally, analytical methods for more advanced analyses have also been briefly summarised. Although there are several advanced options available for monitoring the basic water quality parameters, real\u2010time measurements of more advanced parameters still required require further development.",

Over the years, farming methods have evolved significantly, progressing from Agriculture 1.0, which relied on primitive tools, to Agriculture 2.0, which incorporated machinery and advanced farming practices, and subsequently to Agriculture 3.0, which emphasized mechanization and employed intelligent machinery and technology to enhance productivity levels. To further automate and increase agricultural productivity while minimizing agricultural inputs and pollutants, a new approach to agricultural management based on the concepts of the fourth industrial revolution is being embraced gradually. This approach is referred to as \u201cAgriculture 4.0\u201d and is mainly implemented through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, enabling the remote control of sensors and actuators and the efficient collection and transfer of data. In addition, fueled by technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum sensing, and four-dimensional communication, a new form of smart agriculture, called \u201cAgriculture 5.0,\u201d is now emerging. Agriculture 5.0 can exploit the growing 5G network infrastructure as a basis. However, only 6G-IoT networks will be able to offer the technological advances that will allow the full expansion of Agriculture 5.0, as can be inferred from the relevant scientific literature and research. In this article, we first introduce the scope of Agriculture 5.0 as well as the key features and technologies that will be leveraged in the much-anticipated 6G-IoT communication systems. We then highlight the importance and influence of these developing technologies in the further advancement of smart agriculture and conclude with a discussion of future challenges and opportunities.",

We present four data augmentation operations and a self-supervised learning classification framework that can recognize 60 ECG diagnostic terms. Our model achieves an average area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and average F1 score on the offline test of 0.975 and 0.575. The average sensitivity, specificity and F1-score during the 2-month online test are 0.736, 0.954 and 0.468, respectively.

We conducted interviews with 31 practitioners (i.e., designers, product managers) to understand how they use human-AI guidelines when designing AI-enabled products. Our findings revealed that practitioners use the guidebook not only for addressing AI's design challenges, but also for education, cross-functional communication, and for developing internal resources. We uncovered that practitioners desire more support for early phase ideation and problem formulation to avoid AI product failures. We discuss the implications for future resources aiming to help practitioners in designing AI products.",

        "abstract": "According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, it is projected that the global population will increase by an additional 2 billion individuals by the year 2050. However, the FAO also predicts that only a mere 4% of the Earth's total surface area will be utilized for agricultural purposes. Advancements in technology and innovative solutions to existing limitations in the agricultural sector have facilitated a notable enhancement in agricultural efficiency. The extensive utilization of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the agricultural industry may potentially signify a significant turning point in its historical trajectory. The utilization of AI in farming presents a range of benefits for farmers, including enhanced productivity, reduced expenses, improved crop quality, and expedited go-to-market strategies. This study aims to explore the potential applications of AI in various subsectors of the agriculture industry. This study delves into the exploration of future concepts propelled by AI, while also addressing the anticipated challenges that may arise in their applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the use of the AHP-Gaussian method to support the selection of a smart sensor installation for an electric motor used in an escalator in a subway station. The AHP-Gaussian methodology utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework and is highlighted for its ability to save the decision maker\u2019s cognitive effort in assigning weights to criteria. Seven criteria were defined for the sensor selection: temperature range, vibration range, weight, communication distance, maximum electric power, data traffic speed, and acquisition cost. Four smart sensors were considered as alternatives. The results of the analysis showed that the most appropriate sensor was the ABB Ability smart sensor, which scored the highest in the AHP-Gaussian analysis. In addition, this sensor could detect any abnormalities in the equipment\u2019s operation, enabling timely maintenance and preventing potential failures. The proposed AHP-Gaussian method proved to be an effective approach for selecting a smart sensor for an electric motor used in an escalator in a subway station. The selected sensor was reliable, accurate, and cost-effective, contributing to the safe and efficient operation of the equipment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with a high mortality rate. It is regarded as a significant public health issue because of its complicated pathophysiology, high metastasis, and recurrence rates. There are no obvious symptoms in the early stage of HCC, which often leads to delays in diagnosis. Traditional treatment methods such as surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and interventional therapies have limited therapeutic effects for HCC patients with recurrence or metastasis. With the development of molecular biology and immunology, molecular signaling pathways and immune checkpoint were identified as the main mechanism of HCC progression. Targeting these molecules has become a new direction for the treatment of HCC. At present, the combination of targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors is the first choice for advanced HCC patients. In this review, we mainly focus on the cutting\u2010edge research of signaling pathways and corresponding targeted therapy and immunotherapy in HCC. It is of great significance to comprehensively understand the pathogenesis of HCC, search for potential therapeutic targets, and optimize the treatment strategies of HCC.",

        "abstract": "Computer-aided drug discovery has been around for decades, although the past few years have seen a tectonic shift towards embracing computational technologies in both academia and pharma. This shift is largely defined by the flood of data on ligand properties and binding to therapeutic targets and their 3D structures, abundant computing capacities and the advent of on-demand virtual libraries of drug-like small molecules in their billions. Taking full advantage of these resources requires fast computational methods for effective ligand screening. This includes structure-based virtual screening of gigascale chemical spaces, further facilitated by fast iterative screening approaches. Highly synergistic are developments in deep learning predictions of ligand properties and target activities in lieu of receptor structure. Here we review recent advances in ligand discovery technologies, their potential for reshaping the whole process of drug discovery and development, as well as the challenges they encounter. We also discuss how the rapid identification of highly diverse, potent, target-selective and drug-like ligands to protein targets can democratize the drug discovery process, presenting new opportunities for the cost-effective development of safer and more effective small-molecule treatments.",

        "abstract": "For thousands of years, nature has been a source of medical substances, and an astounding numeral of contemporary remedies have been identified from natural origins. Plants have long been used as folk herbal medicines to treat various disorders, and their different natural products have inspired the design, discovery, and development of new drugs. With the invention of recent molecular targets based on proteins, there is a growing need for fresh chemical diversification in screening. Natural products will play a vital part in supplying this need via the continuous exploration of global biodiversity, the majority of which remains unexplored. Even though drug discovery from medicinal plants remains an important source of novel therapeutic leads, various hurdles exist, including identifying and executing suitable high-throughput screening bioassays, scaling up the supply of bioactive molecules, and acquiring plant materials. Investigating these natural resources takes multi-disciplinary, nationwide, and global partnerships in design, synthesis, discovery, and drug development techniques. This review article discusses current advancements and future approaches for discovering natural items such as health- and wellness-promoting remedies. It also summarizes strategies to unify the therapeutic use of plant-derived natural products worldwide to support future drug discoveries derived from plant sources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Adjuvants are indispensable components of vaccines. Despite being widely used in vaccines, their action mechanisms are not yet clear. With a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which the innate immune response controls the antigen-specific response, the adjuvants\u2019 action mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated. Adjuvants can be categorized as immunostimulants and delivery systems. Immunostimulants are danger signal molecules that lead to the maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by targeting Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to promote the production of antigen signals and co-stimulatory signals, which in turn enhance the adaptive immune responses. On the other hand, delivery systems are carrier materials that facilitate antigen presentation by prolonging the bioavailability of the loaded antigens, as well as targeting antigens to lymph nodes or APCs. The adjuvants\u2019 action mechanisms are systematically summarized at the beginning of this review. This is followed by an introduction of the mechanisms, properties, and progress of classical vaccine adjuvants. Furthermore, since some of the adjuvants under investigation exhibit greater immune activation potency than classical adjuvants, which could compensate for the deficiencies of classical adjuvants, a summary of the adjuvant platforms under investigation is subsequently presented. Notably, we highlight the different action mechanisms and immunological properties of these adjuvant platforms, which will provide a wide range of options for the rational design of different vaccines. On this basis, this review points out the development prospects of vaccine adjuvants and the problems that should be paid attention to in the future.",

        "abstract": "Antibiotics are the most magnificent discovery of 20th century that have saved millions of lives from infectious diseases. Microbes have developed acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to many drugs due to high selection pressure from increasing use and misuse of antibiotics over the years. The transmission and acquisition of AMR occur primarily via human\u2013human interface both within and outside of the healthcare facilities. A huge number of interdependent factors related to healthcare and agriculture govern the development of AMR through various drug resistance mechanisms. The emergence and spread of AMR from the unrestricted use of antimicrobials in livestock feed has been a major contributing factor. The prevalence of AMR bacteria has attained its incongruous level worldwide and threatening global public health as silent pandemic, necessitating urgent intervention. Therapeutic options of AMR bacterial infections are limited resulting in significant morbidity and mortality with high financial impact. The paucity in discovery and supply of new novel antimicrobials to treat life-threatening AMR infections stands in sharp contrast to demand. Immediate interventions to contain AMR include surveillance and monitoring, minimizing over the counter antibiotics and antibiotics in food animals, access to quality and affordable medicines, vaccines and diagnostics, and enforcement of legislation. An orchestral collaborative action within and between multiple national and international organizations are required urgently, otherwise, a post-antibiotic era can be a real possibility than an apocalyptic fantasy for the 21st century. This narrative review highlights on the basis, mechanisms and factors in microbial resistance and key strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

Every tissue in the body has a distinct biomolecular make-up, which is known as its biomarkers, which possess particular features, viz., the levels or activities (the ability of a gene or protein to carry out a particular body function) of a gene, protein, or other biomolecules. A biomarker refers to some feature that can be objectively quantified by various biochemical samples and evaluates the exposure of an organism to normal or pathological procedures or their response to some drug interventions. An in-depth and comprehensive realization of the significance of these biomarkers becomes quite important for the efficient diagnosis of diseases and for providing the appropriate directions in case of multiple drug choices being presently available, which can benefit any patient. Presently, advancements in omics technologies have opened up new possibilities to obtain novel biomarkers of different types, employing genomic strategies, epigenetics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, lipid-based analysis, protein studies, etc. Particular biomarkers for specific diseases, their prognostic capabilities, and responses to therapeutic paradigms have been applied for screening of various normal healthy, as well as diseased, tissue or serum samples, and act as appreciable tools in pharmacology and therapeutics, etc. In this review, we have summarized various biomarker types, their classification, and monitoring and detection methods and strategies. Various analytical techniques and approaches of biomarkers have also been described along with various clinically applicable biomarker sensing techniques which have been developed in the recent past. A section has also been dedicated to the latest trends in the formulation and designing of nanotechnology-based biomarker sensing and detection developments in this field.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of the link between microRNAs (miRNAs) and a myriad of human diseases, particularly various cancer types, has generated significant interest in exploring their potential as a novel class of drugs. This has led to substantial investments in interdisciplinary research fields such as biology, chemistry, and medical science for the development of miRNA-based therapies. Furthermore, the recent global success of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic has further revitalized interest in RNA-based immunotherapies, including miRNA-based approaches to cancer treatment. Consequently, RNA therapeutics have emerged as highly adaptable and modular options for cancer therapy. Moreover, advancements in RNA chemistry and delivery methods have been pivotal in shaping the landscape of RNA-based immunotherapy, including miRNA-based approaches. Consequently, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has witnessed a resurgence of interest in incorporating RNA-based immunotherapies and miRNA therapeutics into their development programs. Despite substantial progress in preclinical research, the field of miRNA-based therapeutics remains in its early stages, with only a few progressing to clinical development, none reaching phase III clinical trials or being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and several facing termination due to toxicity issues. These setbacks highlight existing challenges that must be addressed for the broad clinical application of miRNA-based therapeutics. Key challenges include establishing miRNA sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity towards their intended targets, mitigating immunogenic reactions and off-target effects, developing enhanced methods for targeted delivery, and determining optimal dosing for therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. Additionally, the limited understanding of the precise functions of miRNAs limits their clinical utilization. Moreover, for miRNAs to be viable for cancer treatment, they must be technically and economically feasible for the widespread adoption of RNA therapies. As a result, a thorough risk evaluation of miRNA therapeutics is crucial to minimize off-target effects, prevent overdosing, and address various other issues. Nevertheless, the therapeutic potential of miRNAs for various diseases is evident, and future investigations are essential to determine their applicability in clinical settings.",

Cancer therapy has always been challenging, apart from major advances in immunotherapies, stem cell transplantation, targeted therapies, hormonal therapies, precision medicine, and palliative care, and traditional therapies such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Natural products are integral to the development of innovative anticancer drugs in cancer research, offering the scientific community the possibility of exploring novel natural compounds against cancers. The role of natural products like Vincristine and Vinblastine has been thoroughly implicated in the management of leukemia and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. The computational method is the initial key approach in drug discovery, among various approaches. This review investigates the synergy between natural products and computational techniques, and highlights their significance in the drug discovery process. The transition from computational to experimental validation has been highlighted through in vitro and in vivo studies, with examples such as betulinic acid and withaferin A. The path toward therapeutic applications have been demonstrated through clinical studies of compounds such as silvestrol and artemisinin, from preclinical investigations to clinical trials. This article also addresses the challenges and limitations in the development of natural products as potential anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, the integration of deep learning and artificial intelligence with traditional computational drug discovery methods may be useful for enhancing the anticancer potential of natural products.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer that is difficult to treat due to its resistance to both radiation and chemotherapy. This resistance is largely due to the unique biology of GBM cells, which can evade the effects of conventional treatments through mechanisms such as increased resistance to cell death and rapid regeneration of cancerous cells. Additionally, the blood\u2013brain barrier makes it difficult for chemotherapy drugs to reach GBM cells, leading to reduced effectiveness. Despite these challenges, there are several treatment options available for GBM. The standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients involves surgical resection followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Emerging treatments include immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab, that attempt to attack specific vulnerabilities in GBM cells. Another promising approach is the use of tumor-treating fields, a type of electric field therapy that has been shown to slow the growth of GBM cells. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these and other innovative treatments for GBM, intending to improve with outcomes for patients.",

        "abstract": "Plants uptake and assimilate nitrogen from the soil in the form of nitrate, ammonium ions, and available amino acids from organic sources. Plant nitrate and ammonium transporters are responsible for nitrate and ammonium translocation from the soil into the roots. The unique structure of these transporters determines the specificity of each transporter, and structural analyses reveal the mechanisms by which these transporters function. Following absorption, the nitrogen metabolism pathway incorporates the nitrogen into organic compounds via glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase that convert ammonium ions into glutamine and glutamate. Different isoforms of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase exist, enabling plants to fine-tune nitrogen metabolism based on environmental cues. Under stressful conditions, nitric oxide has been found to enhance plant survival under drought stress. Furthermore, the interaction between salinity stress and nitrogen availability in plants has been studied, with nitric oxide identified as a potential mediator of responses to salt stress. Conversely, excessive use of nitrate fertilizers can lead to health and environmental issues. Therefore, alternative strategies, such as establishing nitrogen fixation in plants through diazotrophic microbiota, have been explored to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers. Ultimately, genomics can identify new genes related to nitrogen fixation, which could be harnessed to improve plant productivity.",

After the histone translation, its amino tail undergoes various modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, malonylation, propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, and lactylation, which together constitute the \u201chistone code.\u201d The relationship between their combination and biological function can be used as an important epigenetic marker. Methylation and demethylation of the same histone residue, acetylation and deacetylation, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and even methylation and acetylation between different histone residues cooperate or antagonize with each other, forming a complex network. Histone\u2010modifying enzymes, which cause numerous histone codes, have become a hot topic in the research on cancer therapeutic targets. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the role of histone post\u2010translational modifications (PTMs) in cell life activities is very important for preventing and treating human diseases. In this review, several most thoroughly studied and newly discovered histone PTMs are introduced. Furthermore, we focus on the histone\u2010modifying enzymes with carcinogenic potential, their abnormal modification sites in various tumors, and multiple essential molecular regulation mechanism. Finally, we summarize the missing areas of the current research and point out the direction of future research.

        "abstract": "Energy storage is a more sustainable choice to meet net-zero carbon foot print and decarbonization of the environment in the pursuit of an energy independent future, green energy transition, and uptake. The journey to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased grid stability and reliability, and improved green energy access and security are the result of innovation in energy storage systems. Renewable energy sources are fundamentally intermittent, which means they rely on the availability of natural resources like the sun and wind rather than continuously producing energy. Due to its ability to address the inherent intermittency of renewable energy sources, manage peak demand, enhance grid stability and reliability, and make it possible to integrate small-scale renewable energy systems into the grid, energy storage is essential for the continued development of renewable energy sources and the decentralization of energy generation. Accordingly, the development of an effective energy storage system has been prompted by the demand for unlimited supply of energy, primarily through harnessing of solar, chemical, and mechanical energy. Nonetheless, in order to achieve green energy transition and mitigate climate risks resulting from the use of fossil-based fuels, robust energy storage systems are necessary. Herein, the need for better, more effective energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors, and bio-batteries is critically reviewed. Due to their low maintenance needs, supercapacitors are the devices of choice for energy storage in renewable energy producing facilities, most notably in harnessing wind energy. Moreover, supercapacitors possess robust charging and discharging cycles, high power density, low maintenance requirements, extended lifespan, and are environmentally friendly. On the other hand, combining aluminum with nonaqueous charge storage materials such as conductive polymers to make use of each material\u2019s unique capabilities could be crucial for continued development of robust storage batteries. In general, energy density is a key component in battery development, and scientists are constantly developing new methods and technologies to make existing batteries more energy proficient and safe. This will make it possible to design energy storage devices that are more powerful and lighter for a range of applications. When there is an imbalance between supply and demand, energy storage systems (ESS) offer a way of increasing the effectiveness of electrical systems. They also play a central role in enhancing the reliability and excellence of electrical networks that can also be deployed in off-grid localities.",

        "abstract": "Throughout evolution, plants have developed a highly complex defense system against different threats, including phytopathogens. Plant defense depends on constitutive and induced factors combined as defense mechanisms. These mechanisms involve a complex signaling network linking structural and biochemical defense. Antimicrobial and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are examples of this mechanism, which can accumulate extra- and intracellular space after infection. However, despite their name, some PR proteins are present at low levels even in healthy plant tissues. When they face a pathogen, these PRs can increase in abundance, acting as the first line of plant defense. Thus, PRs play a key role in early defense events, which can reduce the damage and mortality caused by pathogens. In this context, the present review will discuss defense response proteins, which have been identified as PRs, with enzymatic action, including constitutive enzymes, \u03b2-1,3 glucanase, chitinase, peroxidase and ribonucleases. From the technological perspective, we discuss the advances of the last decade applied to the study of these enzymes, which are important in the early events of higher plant defense against phytopathogens.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Molecular docking is a computational technique that predicts the binding affinity of ligands to receptor proteins. Although it has potential uses in nutraceutical research, it has developed into a formidable tool for drug development. Bioactive substances called nutraceuticals are present in food sources and can be used in the management of diseases. Finding their molecular targets can help in the creation of disease-specific new therapies. The purpose of this review was to explore molecular docking's application to the study of dietary supplements and disease management. First, an overview of the fundamentals of molecular docking and the various software tools available for docking was presented. The limitations and difficulties of using molecular docking in nutraceutical research are also covered, including the reliability of scoring functions and the requirement for experimental validation. Additionally, there was a focus on the identification of molecular targets for nutraceuticals in numerous disease models, including those for sickle cell disease, cancer, cardiovascular, gut, reproductive, and neurodegenerative disorders. We further highlighted biochemistry pathways and models from recent studies that have revealed molecular mechanisms to pinpoint new nutraceuticals' effects on disease pathogenesis. It is convincingly true that molecular docking is a useful tool for identifying the molecular targets of nutraceuticals in the management of diseases. It may offer information about how nutraceuticals work and support the creation of new therapeutics. Therefore, molecular docking has a bright future in nutraceutical research and has a lot of potentials to lead to the creation of brand-new medicines for the treatment of disease.",

Although the underlying reasons are generally understood, traditional intervention strategies rooted in patient-centric education and empowerment have proved to be prohibitively complex and/or ineffective. Formulating a pharmaceutical in a drug delivery system (DDS) is a promising alternative that can directly mitigate many common impediments to adherence, including frequent dosing, adverse effects and a delayed onset of action. Existing DDSs have already positively influenced patient acceptability and improved rates of adherence across various disease and intervention types. The next generation of systems have the potential to instate an even more radical paradigm shift by, for example, permitting oral delivery of biomacromolecules, allowing for autonomous dose regulation and enabling several doses to be mimicked with a single administration. Their success, however, is contingent on their ability to address the problems that have made DDSs unsuccessful in the past.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The interleukin-17 (IL-17) family comprises six members (IL-17A\u201317F), and recently, all of its related receptors have been discovered. IL-17 was first discovered approximately 30 years ago. Members of this family have various biological functions, including driving an inflammatory cascade during infections and autoimmune diseases, as well as boosting protective immunity against various pathogens. IL-17 is a highly versatile proinflammatory cytokine necessary for vital processes including host immune defenses, tissue repair, inflammatory disease pathogenesis, and cancer progression. However, how IL-17 performs these functions remains controversial. The multifunctional properties of IL-17 have attracted research interest, and emerging data have gradually improved our understanding of the IL-17 signaling pathway. However, a comprehensive review is required to understand its role in both host defense functions and pathogenesis in the body. This review can aid researchers in better understanding the mechanisms underlying IL-17\u2019s roles in vivo and provide a theoretical basis for future studies aiming to regulate IL-17 expression and function. This review discusses recent progress in understanding the IL-17 signaling pathway and its physiological roles. In addition, we present the mechanism underlying IL-17\u2019s role in various pathologies, particularly, in IL-17-induced systemic lupus erythematosus and IL-17-related tumor cell transformation and metastasis. In addition, we have briefly discussed promising developments in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases and tumors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cancer, a complex and multifactorial disease, presents a significant challenge to global health. Despite significant advances in surgical, radiotherapeutic and immunological approaches, which have improved cancer treatment outcomes, drug therapy continues to serve as a key therapeutic strategy. However, the clinical efficacy of drug therapy is often constrained by drug resistance and severe toxic side effects, and thus there remains a critical need to develop novel cancer therapeutics. One promising strategy that has received widespread attention in recent years is drug repurposing: the identification of new applications for existing, clinically approved drugs. Drug repurposing possesses several inherent advantages in the context of cancer treatment since repurposed drugs are typically cost-effective, proven to be safe, and can significantly expedite the drug development process due to their already established safety profiles. In light of this, the present review offers a comprehensive overview of the various methods employed in drug repurposing, specifically focusing on the repurposing of drugs to treat cancer. We describe the antitumor properties of candidate drugs, and discuss in detail how they target both the hallmarks of cancer in tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment. In addition, we examine the innovative strategy of integrating drug repurposing with nanotechnology to enhance topical drug delivery. We also emphasize the critical role that repurposed drugs can play when used as part of a combination therapy regimen. To conclude, we outline the challenges associated with repurposing drugs and consider the future prospects of these repurposed drugs transitioning into clinical application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract TLR4, a transmembrane receptor, plays a central role in the innate immune response. TLR4 not only engages with exogenous ligands at the cellular membrane\u2019s surface but also interacts with intracellular ligands, initiating intricate intracellular signaling cascades. Through MyD88, an adaptor protein, TLR4 activates transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1, thereby facilitating the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Another adapter protein linked to TLR4, known as TRIF, autonomously propagates signaling pathways, resulting in heightened interferon expression. Recently, TLR4 has garnered attention as a significant factor in the regulation of symptoms in aging-related disorders. The persistent inflammatory response triggered by TLR4 contributes to the onset and exacerbation of these disorders. In addition, alterations in TLR4 expression levels play a pivotal role in modifying the manifestations of age-related diseases. In this review, we aim to consolidate the impact of TLR4 on cellular senescence and aging-related ailments, highlighting the potential of TLR4 as a novel therapeutic target that extends beyond immune responses.",

Here we review and critically evaluate the evidence for the most promising biomarkers in the psychiatric neuroscience literature for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and post\u2010traumatic stress disorder, major depression and bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. Candidate biomarkers reviewed include various neuroimaging, genetic, molecular and peripheral assays, for the purposes of determining susceptibility or presence of illness, and predicting treatment response or safety. This review highlights a critical gap in the biomarker validation process. An enormous societal investment over the past 50 years has identified numerous candidate biomarkers. However, to date, the overwhelming majority of these measures have not been proven sufficiently reliable, valid and useful to be adopted clinically. It is time to consider whether strategic investments might break this impasse, focusing on a limited number of promising candidates to advance through a process of definitive testing for a specific indication. Some promising candidates for definitive testing include the N170 signal, an event\u2010related brain potential measured using electroencephalography, for subgroup identification within autism spectrum disorder; striatal resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures, such as the striatal connectivity index (SCI) and the functional striatal abnormalities (FSA) index, for prediction of treatment response in schizophrenia; error\u2010related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological index, for prediction of first onset of generalized anxiety disorder, and resting\u2010state and structural brain connectomic measures for prediction of treatment response in social anxiety disorder. Alternate forms of classification may be useful for conceptualizing and testing potential biomarkers. Collaborative efforts allowing the inclusion of biosystems beyond genetics and neuroimaging are needed, and online remote acquisition of selected measures in a naturalistic setting using mobile health tools may significantly advance the field. Setting specific benchmarks for well\u2010defined target application, along with development of appropriate funding and partnership mechanisms, would also be crucial. Finally, it should never be forgotten that, for a biomarker to be actionable, it will need to be clinically predictive at the individual level and viable in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Hematological toxicity is the most common adverse event after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Cytopenias can be profound and long-lasting and can predispose for severe infectious complications. In a recent worldwide survey, we demonstrated that there remains considerable heterogeneity in regard to current practice patterns. Here, we sought to build consensus on the grading and management of immune effector cell\u2013associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT) after CAR T-cell therapy. For this purpose, a joint effort between the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and the European Hematology Association (EHA) involved an international panel of 36 CAR T-cell experts who met in a series of virtual conferences, culminating in a 2-day meeting in Lille, France. On the basis of these deliberations, best practice recommendations were developed. For the grading of ICAHT, a classification system based on depth and duration of neutropenia was developed for early (day 0-30) and late (after day +30) cytopenia. Detailed recommendations on risk factors, available preinfusion scoring systems (eg, CAR-HEMATOTOX score), and diagnostic workup are provided. A further section focuses on identifying hemophagocytosis in the context of severe hematotoxicity. Finally, we review current evidence and provide consensus recommendations for the management of ICAHT, including growth factor support, anti-infectious prophylaxis, transfusions, autologous hematopoietic stem cell boost, and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In conclusion, we propose ICAHT as a novel toxicity category after immune effector cell therapy, provide a framework for its grading, review literature on risk factors, and outline expert recommendations for the diagnostic workup and short- and long-term management.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation. The etiology of IBD is multifactorial and results from a complex interplay between mucosal immunity, environmental factors, and host genetics. Future therapeutics for GI disorders, including IBD, that are driven by oxidative stress require a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the GI tract, oxidative stressors include infections and pro-inflammatory responses, which boost ROS generation by promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2) represent two important signaling pathways in intestinal immune cells that regulate numerous physiological processes, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Natural antioxidant compounds exhibit ROS scavenging and increase antioxidant defense capacity to inhibit pro-oxidative enzymes, which may be useful in IBD treatment. In this review, we discuss various polyphenolic substances (such as resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, green tea flavonoids, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, luteolin, xanthohumol, genistein, alpinetin, proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, silymarin), phenolic compounds including thymol, alkaloids such as berberine, storage polysaccharides such as tamarind xyloglucan, and other phytochemicals represented by isothiocyanate sulforaphane and food/spices (such as ginger, flaxseed oil), as well as antioxidant hormones like melatonin that target cellular signaling pathways to reduce intestinal inflammation occurring with IBD.",

        "title": "Back to Nature: Medicinal Plants as Promising Sources for Antibacterial Drugs in the Post-Antibiotic Era",
        "abstract": "Undoubtedly, the advent of antibiotics in the 19th century had a substantial impact, increasing human life expectancy. However, a multitude of scientific investigations now indicate that we are currently experiencing a phase known as the post-antibiotic era. There is a genuine concern that we might regress to a time before antibiotics and confront widespread outbreaks of severe epidemic diseases, particularly those caused by bacterial infections. These investigations have demonstrated that epidemics thrive under environmental stressors such as climate change, the depletion of natural resources, and detrimental human activities such as wars, conflicts, antibiotic overuse, and pollution. Moreover, bacteria possess a remarkable ability to adapt and mutate. Unfortunately, the current development of antibiotics is insufficient, and the future appears grim unless we abandon our current approach of generating synthetic antibiotics that rapidly lose their effectiveness against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Despite their vital role in modern medicine, medicinal plants have served as the primary source of curative drugs since ancient times. Numerous scientific reports published over the past three decades suggest that medicinal plants could serve as a promising alternative to ineffective antibiotics in combating infectious diseases. Over the past few years, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, saponins, and terpenoids have exhibited noteworthy antibacterial potential, primarily through membrane-disruption mechanisms, protein binding, interference with intermediary metabolism, anti-quorum sensing, and anti-biofilm activity. However, to optimize their utilization as effective antibacterial drugs, further advancements in omics technologies and network pharmacology will be required in order to identify optimal combinations among these compounds or in conjunction with antibiotics.",

This research summarizes the types, biological functions, and regulatory mechanisms of SODs, as well as their applications in medicine, food production, and cosmetic production. SODs have proven to be a useful tool in fighting disease, and mimetics and conjugates that report SODs have been developed successively to improve the effectiveness of SODs.

        "abstract": "Polyphenols, as common components with various functional activities in plants, have become a research hotspot. However, researchers have found that the bioavailability and bioactivity of plant polyphenols is generally low because they are usually in the form of tannins, anthocyanins and glycosides. Polyphenol-rich fermented foods (PFFs) are reported to have better bioavailability and bioactivity than polyphenol-rich foods, because polyphenols are used as substrates during food fermentation and are hydrolyzed into smaller phenolic compounds (such as quercetin, kaempferol, gallic acid, ellagic acid, etc.) with higher bioactivity and bioavailability by polyphenol-associated enzymes (PAEs, e.g., tannases, esterases, phenolic acid decarboxylases and glycosidases). Biotransformation pathways of different polyphenols by PAEs secreted by different microorganisms are different. Meanwhile, polyphenols could also promote the growth of beneficial bacteria during the fermentation process while inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, during the fermentation of PFFs, there must be an interactive relationship between polyphenols and microorganisms. The present study is an integration and analysis of the interaction mechanism between PFFs and microorganisms and is systematically elaborated. The present study will provide some new insights to explore the bioavailability and bioactivity of polyphenol-rich foods and greater exploitation of the availability of functional components (such as polyphenols) in plant-derived foods.",

As the demand for peptide-based therapies grows, so does the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis methods. Traditional peptide synthesis, while effective, often involves environmentally draining processes, generating significant waste and consuming vast resources. The integration of green chemistry offers sustainable alternatives, prioritizing eco-friendly processes, waste reduction, and energy conservation.

        "abstract": "Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent disorder of brain-gut interactions that affects between 5 and 10% of the general population worldwide. The current symptom criteria restrict the diagnosis to recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits, but the majority of patients also report non-painful abdominal discomfort, associated psychiatric conditions (anxiety and depression), as well as other visceral and somatic pain-related symptoms. For decades, IBS was considered an intestinal motility disorder, and more recently a gut disorder. However, based on an extensive body of reported information about central, peripheral mechanisms and genetic factors involved in the pathophysiology of IBS symptoms, a comprehensive disease model of brain-gut-microbiome interactions has emerged, which can explain altered bowel habits, chronic abdominal pain, and psychiatric comorbidities. In this review, we will first describe novel insights into several key components of brain-gut microbiome interactions, starting with reported alterations in the gut connectome and enteric nervous system, and a list of distinct functional and structural brain signatures, and comparing them to the proposed brain alterations in anxiety disorders. We will then point out the emerging correlations between the brain networks with the genomic, gastrointestinal, immune, and gut microbiome-related parameters. We will incorporate this new information into a systems-based disease model of IBS. Finally, we will discuss the implications of such a model for the improved understanding of the disorder and the development of more effective treatment approaches in the future.",

        "abstract": "Climate change causes long-term weather changes from the tropics to the polls. It is a global threat that strains several sectors. The present study conducts a review analysis that theoretically explores how climatic variability is degrading global sector sustainability. Due to irreversible weather variations, the agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable. In turn, it is disrupting worldwide consumption patterns, especially in countries where agriculture is central to their economy and productivity. Due to shifting optimum temperature ranges, climate change is also increasing biodiversity loss through modifying ecosystem architecture. Climate change increases the risk of food, water, and vector-borne diseases. Antimicrobial resistance, which is developing due to resistant pathogenic infections, is also accelerated by climate change. Climate change also hurts the forestry sector and tourism business. This review examines global socio-economic and environmental climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and their economic consequences. According to the findings, knotted answerability of resources and laws created in the past to generate progressive climate policy need government involvement for long-term development. Thus, addressing climate change's dire consequences demands global cooperation to maintain world survival.",

The imprudent use of antibiotics in humans and animals has resulted in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The dissemination of these strains and their resistant determinants could endanger antibiotic efficacy.

        "abstract": "Abstract Climate change, biodiversity loss, and chemical pollution are planetary\u2010scale emergencies requiring urgent mitigation actions. As these \u201ctriple crises\u201d are deeply interlinked, they need to be tackled in an integrative manner. However, while climate change and biodiversity are often studied together, chemical pollution as a global change factor contributing to worldwide biodiversity loss has received much less attention in biodiversity research so far. Here, we review evidence showing that the multifaceted effects of anthropogenic chemicals in the environment are posing a growing threat to biodiversity and ecosystems. Therefore, failure to account for pollution effects may significantly undermine the success of biodiversity protection efforts. We argue that progress in understanding and counteracting the negative impact of chemical pollution on biodiversity requires collective efforts of scientists from different disciplines, including but not limited to ecology, ecotoxicology, and environmental chemistry. Importantly, recent developments in these fields have now enabled comprehensive studies that could efficiently address the manifold interactions between chemicals and ecosystems. Based on their experience with intricate studies of biodiversity, ecologists are well equipped to embrace the additional challenge of chemical complexity through interdisciplinary collaborations. This offers a unique opportunity to jointly advance a seminal frontier in pollution ecology and facilitate the development of innovative solutions for environmental protection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs), through their complex cargo, can reflect the state of their cell of origin and change the functions and phenotypes of other cells. These features indicate strong biomarker and therapeutic potential and have generated broad interest, as evidenced by the steady year\u2010on\u2010year increase in the numbers of scientific publications about EVs. Important advances have been made in EV metrology and in understanding and applying EV biology. However, hurdles remain to realising the potential of EVs in domains ranging from basic biology to clinical applications due to challenges in EV nomenclature, separation from non\u2010vesicular extracellular particles, characterisation and functional studies. To address the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) updates its \u2018Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles\u2019, which was first published in 2014 and then in 2018 as MISEV2014 and MISEV2018, respectively. The goal of the current document, MISEV2023, is to provide researchers with an updated snapshot of available approaches and their advantages and limitations for production, separation and characterisation of EVs from multiple sources, including cell culture, body fluids and solid tissues. In addition to presenting the latest state of the art in basic principles of EV research, this document also covers advanced techniques and approaches that are currently expanding the boundaries of the field. MISEV2023 also includes new sections on EV release and uptake and a brief discussion of in vivo approaches to study EVs. Compiling feedback from ISEV expert task forces and more than 1000 researchers, this document conveys the current state of EV research to facilitate robust scientific discoveries and move the field forward even more rapidly.",

This study is based on a general literature review uncovering the role of AI in healthcare and focuses on the following key aspects: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics, (ii) virtual patient care, (iii) medical research and drug discovery, (iv) patient engagement and compliance, (v) rehabilitation, and (vi) other administrative applications. The impact of AI is observed in detecting clinical conditions in medical imaging and diagnostic services, controlling the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with early diagnosis, providing virtual patient care using AI-powered tools, managing electronic health records, augmenting patient engagement and compliance with the treatment plan, reducing the administrative workload of healthcare professionals (HCPs), discovering new drugs and vaccines, spotting medical prescription errors, extensive data storage and analysis, and technology-assisted rehabilitation. Nevertheless, this science pitch meets several technical, ethical, and social challenges, including privacy, safety, the right to decide and try, costs, information and consent, access, and efficacy, while integrating AI into healthcare. The governance of AI applications is crucial for patient safety and accountability and for raising HCPs\u2019 belief in enhancing acceptance and boosting significant health consequences. Effective governance is a prerequisite to precisely address regulatory, ethical, and trust issues while advancing the acceptance and implementation of AI. Since COVID-19 hit the global health system, the concept of AI has created a revolution in healthcare, and such an uprising could be another step forward to meet future healthcare needs.",

Additive manufacturing (AM) of intricate geometries using multi-materials provides additional functionality, environmental adaptation, and improved mechanical properties. Recently, several studies have been conducted on multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) technologies, including multi-materials, methodologies, design, and optimization. However, in the past six years, very few or no systematic and complete reviews have been conducted in this research domain. This review intends to comprehensively summarize MMAM systems and the working principles of its fundamental processes. Herein, the Multi-material combinations and their design, modeling, and analysis strategies have been reviewed systematically. In particular, the focus is on applications and opportunities for using MMAM for several industries and postprocessing MMAM fabricated parts. Furthermore, this review identified the limitations and challenges of existing software packages, MMAM processes, materials, and joining mechanisms, especially at the multi-material interfaces. Finally, we discuss the possible strategies to overcome the aforementioned technological challenges and state the future directions, which will provide insights to researchers and engineers designing and manufacturing complex nature-inspired objects.",

Current trends in the development of hydrogel drug delivery systems involve the release of drugs in response to specific triggers such as pH, temperature, or enzymes for targeted drug delivery and to reduce the potential for systemic toxicity. In addition, developing injectable hydrogel formulations that are easily used and sustain drug release during this extended time is a growing interest. Another emerging trend in hydrogel drug delivery is the synthesis of nano hydrogels and other functional substances for improving targeted drug loading and release efficacy. Following these development trends, advanced hydrogels possessing mechanically improved properties, controlled release rates, and biocompatibility is developing as a focus of the field. More complex drug delivery systems such as multi-drug delivery and combination therapies will be developed based on these advancements. In addition, polymer-based hydrogels are gaining increasing attention in personalized medicine because of their ability to be tailored to a specific patient, for example, drug release rates, drug combinations, target-specific drug delivery, improvement of disease treatment effectiveness, and healthcare cost reduction. Overall, hydrogel application is advancing rapidly, towards more efficient and effective drug delivery systems in the future.",

        "abstract": "The human nature of curiosity, wonder, and ingenuity date back to the age of humankind. In parallel with our history of civilization, interest in scientific approaches to unravel mechanisms underlying natural phenomena has been developing. Recent years have witnessed unprecedented growth in research in the area of pharmaceuticals and medicine. The optimism that nanotechnology (NT) applied to medicine and drugs is taking serious steps to bring about significant advances in diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease\u2014a shift from fantasy to reality. The growing interest in the future medical applications of NT leads to the emergence of a new field for nanomaterials (NMs) and biomedicine. In recent years, NMs have emerged as essential game players in modern medicine, with clinical applications ranging from contrast agents in imaging to carriers for drug and gene delivery into tumors. Indeed, there are instances where nanoparticles (NPs) enable analyses and therapies that cannot be performed otherwise. However, NPs also bring unique environmental and societal challenges, particularly concerning toxicity. Thus, clinical applications of NPs should be revisited, and a deep understanding of the effects of NPs from the pathophysiologic basis of a disease may bring more sophisticated diagnostic opportunities and yield more effective therapies and preventive features. Correspondingly, this review highlights the significant contributions of NPs to modern medicine and drug delivery systems. This study also attempted to glimpse the future impact of NT in medicine and pharmaceuticals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The recently published Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for the treatment of stages I\u2013IV periodontitis provided evidence\u2010based recommendations for treating periodontitis patients, defined according to the 2018 classification. Peri\u2010implant diseases were also re\u2010defined in the 2018 classification. It is well established that both peri\u2010implant mucositis and peri\u2010implantitis are highly prevalent. In addition, peri\u2010implantitis is particularly challenging to manage and is accompanied by significant morbidity. Aim To develop an S3 level CPG for the prevention and treatment of peri\u2010implant diseases, focusing on the implementation of interdisciplinary approaches required to prevent the development of peri\u2010implant diseases or their recurrence, and to treat/rehabilitate patients with dental implants following the development of peri\u2010implant diseases. Materials and Methods This S3 level CPG was developed by the European Federation of Periodontology, following methodological guidance from the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process. A rigorous and transparent process included synthesis of relevant research in 13 specifically commissioned systematic reviews, evaluation of the quality and strength of evidence, formulation of specific recommendations, and a structured consensus process involving leading experts and a broad base of stakeholders. Results The S3 level CPG for the prevention and treatment of peri\u2010implant diseases culminated in the recommendation for implementation of various different interventions before, during and after implant placement/loading. Prevention of peri\u2010implant diseases should commence when dental implants are planned, surgically placed and prosthetically loaded. Once the implants are loaded and in function, a supportive peri\u2010implant care programme should be structured, including periodical assessment of peri\u2010implant tissue health. If peri\u2010implant mucositis or peri\u2010implantitis are detected, appropriate treatments for their management must be rendered. Conclusion The present S3 level CPG informs clinical practice, health systems, policymakers and, indirectly, the public on the available and most effective modalities to maintain healthy peri\u2010implant tissues, and to manage peri\u2010implant diseases, according to the available evidence at the time of publication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cancer, a complex and multifactorial disease, presents a significant challenge to global health. Despite significant advances in surgical, radiotherapeutic and immunological approaches, which have improved cancer treatment outcomes, drug therapy continues to serve as a key therapeutic strategy. However, the clinical efficacy of drug therapy is often constrained by drug resistance and severe toxic side effects, and thus there remains a critical need to develop novel cancer therapeutics. One promising strategy that has received widespread attention in recent years is drug repurposing: the identification of new applications for existing, clinically approved drugs. Drug repurposing possesses several inherent advantages in the context of cancer treatment since repurposed drugs are typically cost-effective, proven to be safe, and can significantly expedite the drug development process due to their already established safety profiles. In light of this, the present review offers a comprehensive overview of the various methods employed in drug repurposing, specifically focusing on the repurposing of drugs to treat cancer. We describe the antitumor properties of candidate drugs, and discuss in detail how they target both the hallmarks of cancer in tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment. In addition, we examine the innovative strategy of integrating drug repurposing with nanotechnology to enhance topical drug delivery. We also emphasize the critical role that repurposed drugs can play when used as part of a combination therapy regimen. To conclude, we outline the challenges associated with repurposing drugs and consider the future prospects of these repurposed drugs transitioning into clinical application.",

Through it, scientists are acquiring the ability to understand the structure and properties of materials and manipulate them at the scale of atoms and molecules. Nanomaterials are at the forefront of the rapidly growing field of nanotechnology. The synthesis of nanostructured materials, especially metallic nanoparticles, has attracted tremendous interest over the past decade due to their unique properties, making these materials excellent and indispensable in many areas of human activity. These special properties can be attributed to the small size and large specific surface area of nanoparticles, which are very different from those of bulk materials. Nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes are needed for many applications, so a variety of protocols are required to produce monodisperse nanoparticles with controlled morphology. The purpose of this review is firstly to introduce the reader to the basic aspects related to the field of nanotechnology and, secondly, to discuss metallic nanoparticles in greater detail. This article explains the basic concepts of nanotechnology, introduces methods for synthesizing nanoparticles, and describes their types, properties, and possible applications. Of many methods proposed for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles, a chemical reduction is usually preferred because it is easy to perform, cost-effective, efficient, and also allows control of the structural parameters through optimization of the synthesis conditions. Therefore, a chemical reduction method is discussed in more detail\u2014each factor needed for the synthesis of nanoparticles by chemical reduction is described in detail, i.e., metal precursors, solvents, reducing agents, and stabilizers.

In this study, we develop a natural biological adhesive from snail mucus gel, which consists a network of positively charged protein and polyanionic glycosaminoglycan. The malleable bulk adhesive matrix can adhere to wet tissue through multiple interactions. The biomaterial exhibits excellent haemostatic activity, biocompatibility and biodegradability, and it is effective in accelerating the healing of full-thickness skin wounds in both normal and diabetic male rats. Further mechanistic study shows it effectively promotes the polarization of macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype, alleviates inflammation in chronic wounds, and significantly improves epithelial regeneration and angiogenesis. Its abundant heparin-like glycosaminoglycan component is the main active ingredient. These findings provide theoretical and material insights into bio-inspired tissue adhesives and bioengineered scaffold designs.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in human stem cell-derived brain organoids promise to replicate critical molecular and cellular aspects of learning and memory and possibly aspects of cognition in vitro . Coining the term \u201corganoid intelligence\u201d (OI) to encompass these developments, we present a collaborative program to implement the vision of a multidisciplinary field of OI. This aims to establish OI as a form of genuine biological computing that harnesses brain organoids using scientific and bioengineering advances in an ethically responsible manner. Standardized, 3D, myelinated brain organoids can now be produced with high cell density and enriched levels of glial cells and gene expression critical for learning. Integrated microfluidic perfusion systems can support scalable and durable culturing, and spatiotemporal chemical signaling. Novel 3D microelectrode arrays permit high-resolution spatiotemporal electrophysiological signaling and recording to explore the capacity of brain organoids to recapitulate the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory formation and, ultimately, their computational potential. Technologies that could enable novel biocomputing models via stimulus-response training and organoid-computer interfaces are in development. We envisage complex, networked interfaces whereby brain organoids are connected with real-world sensors and output devices, and ultimately with each other and with sensory organ organoids (e.g. retinal organoids), and are trained using biofeedback, big-data warehousing, and machine learning methods. In parallel, we emphasize an embedded ethics approach to analyze the ethical aspects raised by OI research in an iterative, collaborative manner involving all relevant stakeholders. The many possible applications of this research urge the strategic development of OI as a scientific discipline. We anticipate OI-based biocomputing systems to allow faster decision-making, continuous learning during tasks, and greater energy and data efficiency. Furthermore, the development of \u201cintelligence-in-a-dish\u201d could help elucidate the pathophysiology of devastating developmental and degenerative diseases (such as dementia), potentially aiding the identification of novel therapeutic approaches to address major global unmet needs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper undertakes a broad and comprehensive synthesis of relevant clinical, biological, biomechanical, technical and healthcare services data to understand the factors affecting outcomes of periapical healing after root canal (re)treatment. The medical and dental evidence\u2010based era (1980\u2013present) is contextualized with the earlier evidence drive in endodontics (1911\u20131940) triggered by the focal infection era. The current evidence\u2010based approach has a sharper focus on evidence quality and derivation of practice guidelines. Contrary views question whether guideline\u2010driven, or expertise\u2010development\u2010driven endeavours would best serve outcome improvement in society. The endodontic discipline functions in a broad healthcare framework and sustains industrial, economic and trend pressures that may be deemed to influence outcomes. The nature of root canal treatment and the challenges in determining the factors that affect its outcomes is discussed. The factors potentially affecting periapical healing after root canal treatment are classified into pre\u2010operative, intra\u2010operative and postoperative groups. These categories subsume multiple elements with interactive influences, creating a complex picture, further confounded by some apparently surprising, counter\u2010intuitive and contradictory findings. The technical versus biological conundrum in root canal treatment continues to cause cognitive dissonance. However, due reflection and cross\u2010discipline\u2010synthesis resolve the apparent data conflicts into a very simple, consistent and plausible picture of how root canal treatment works and the key factors that affect periapical healing. Root canal retreatment is considered mainly in the context of its differences from primary treatment as the majority of factors influencing outcomes are common to both. The exceptional difference is that retreatments have a proportionately reduced probability of healing by virtue of compromised apical root canal ramification access or modified host/infection interactions. Root canal (re)treatment outcomes are dominantly influenced by the nature of prior dynamic host/infection interaction (pre\u2010operative patient factors) and how the direction of this dynamic is influenced by two factors: (1) the active efficacy of the operators' root canal treatment protocol to sustain a microbial ecological shift (intra\u2010operative treatment factors) and dampen periapical inflammation; and (2) the passive ability of the functional tooth (and its restoration margin) to maintain its integrity to resist infection reversal (postoperative restorative factors).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Hydrogels are three-dimensional cross-linked stable network insoluble in water, which gives them a remarkable capacity to absorb both water and biological fluids. Hydrogel has been synthesized from natural or synthetic polymers and/or monomers, which have made tremendous advancements in many different applications. Composite hydrogel is a type of hydrogel prepared by grafting hydrophilic groups, such as hydroxyl (\u2013OH), carboxylic acid (\u2013COOH), imide (\u2013CONH), sulfonic acid (\u2013SO 3 H), amine (\u2013NH 2 ), and amide (\u2013CONH 2 ), into the polymer chain\u2019s backbone and adding some additives such as kaolin, zeolite, or even different types of nanoparticles. Whereas the polymeric composite hydrogels exhibit stimuli for different properties such as pH, temperature, or light, which may affect swelling, mechanical properties, and self-healing, which in turn play vital roles in different areas. Hence, numerous efforts have been made to synthesize polymer-based composited hydrogels via physical or chemical crosslinking techniques to enhance their physiochemical, biological, and many other properties. Many researchers are currently paying attention to hydrogels and their applications, including wastewater treatment and purification, medical and biomedical applications, agricultural applications, and many other industrial applications. The aim of this review is to summarize the classification of composite hydrogels based on their chemical and physical crosslinking techniques, in addition to the different polymers and additives used to prepare composite hydrogels. Furthermore, the impact of hydrogel on health and the environment has been discussed. Other significant issues were also presented, including the challenges that face hydrogel production and application, which have been discussed.",

        "abstract": "Natural polymers are very widespread in the world, which is why it is so important to know about the possibilities of their use. Chitin is the second most abundant reproducible natural polymer in nature; however, it is insoluble in water and basic solvents. Chitin is an unused waste of the food industry, for which there are possibilities of secondary management. The research led to obtaining a soluble, environmentally friendly form of chitin, which has found potential applications in the many fields, e.g., medicine, cosmetics, food and textile industries, agriculture, etc. The deacetylated form of chitin, which is chitosan, has a number of beneficial properties and wide possibilities of modification. Modification possibilities mean that we can obtain chitosan with the desired functional properties, facilitating, for example, the processing of this polymer and expanding the possibilities of its application, also as biomimetic materials. The review contains a rich description of the possibilities of modifying chitin and chitosan and the main directions of their application, and life cycle assessment (LCA)\u2014from the source of the polymer through production materials to various applications with the reduction of waste.",

Their mode of action is governed by the environmental stimuli viz. temperature, pH, ionic concentration, magnetism, and so on. pH\u2010responsive polymers, because of their self\u2010assembling behavior, alter their solubility, conformation, surface activity, and hydrophilicity when exposed to a specific pH.

The non\u2010invasive drug delivery routes like oral, ocular, nasal, pulmonary, transdermal, and rectal routes can be explored for targeting recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecules with particular emphasis on the individual's physiological and pathological state. Further, these polymers can be designed into various architectures like dendrimers, liposomes, micelles, and metallic nanoparticles that can serve as drug reservoirs for sustaining drug release. The challenges in this field are the selection of biocompatible polymers with ease of synthesis and scale\u2010up, ensuring effective drug\u2010loading, and stability aspects, producing robust pharmacological data, and timely regulatory approvals.

        "title": "A Review on the Recent Advances in Battery Development and Energy Storage Technologies",
        "abstract": "Energy storage is a more sustainable choice to meet net-zero carbon foot print and decarbonization of the environment in the pursuit of an energy independent future, green energy transition, and uptake. The journey to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased grid stability and reliability, and improved green energy access and security are the result of innovation in energy storage systems. Renewable energy sources are fundamentally intermittent, which means they rely on the availability of natural resources like the sun and wind rather than continuously producing energy. Due to its ability to address the inherent intermittency of renewable energy sources, manage peak demand, enhance grid stability and reliability, and make it possible to integrate small-scale renewable energy systems into the grid, energy storage is essential for the continued development of renewable energy sources and the decentralization of energy generation. Accordingly, the development of an effective energy storage system has been prompted by the demand for unlimited supply of energy, primarily through harnessing of solar, chemical, and mechanical energy. Nonetheless, in order to achieve green energy transition and mitigate climate risks resulting from the use of fossil-based fuels, robust energy storage systems are necessary. Herein, the need for better, more effective energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors, and bio-batteries is critically reviewed. Due to their low maintenance needs, supercapacitors are the devices of choice for energy storage in renewable energy producing facilities, most notably in harnessing wind energy. Moreover, supercapacitors possess robust charging and discharging cycles, high power density, low maintenance requirements, extended lifespan, and are environmentally friendly. On the other hand, combining aluminum with nonaqueous charge storage materials such as conductive polymers to make use of each material\u2019s unique capabilities could be crucial for continued development of robust storage batteries. In general, energy density is a key component in battery development, and scientists are constantly developing new methods and technologies to make existing batteries more energy proficient and safe. This will make it possible to design energy storage devices that are more powerful and lighter for a range of applications. When there is an imbalance between supply and demand, energy storage systems (ESS) offer a way of increasing the effectiveness of electrical systems. They also play a central role in enhancing the reliability and excellence of electrical networks that can also be deployed in off-grid localities.",

To address this, wearable vapor sensors can help people monitor air composition in real time to avoid underlying risks, and for the early detection and treatment of diseases for home healthcare. Hydrogels with three-dimensional polymer networks and large amounts of water molecules are naturally flexible and stretchable. Functionalized hydrogels are intrinsically conductive, self-healing, self-adhesive, biocompatible, and room-temperature sensitive. Compared with traditional rigid vapor sensors, hydrogel-based gas and humidity sensors can directly fit human skin or clothing, and are more suitable for real-time monitoring of personal health and safety. In this review, current studies on hydrogel-based vapor sensors are investigated. The required properties and optimization methods of wearable hydrogel-based sensors are introduced. Subsequently, existing reports on the response mechanisms of hydrogel-based gas and humidity sensors are summarized. Related works on hydrogel-based vapor sensors for their application in personal health and safety monitoring are presented. Moreover, the potential of hydrogels in the field of vapor sensing is elucidated. Finally, the current research status, challenges, and future trends of hydrogel gas/humidity sensing are discussed.",

While exosomes derived from adipose tissue-derived stem cells have shown promise in accelerating healing by carrying therapeutic growth factors and microRNAs, intracellular cargo delivery is compromised in hypoxic tissues due to activated hypoxia-induced endocytic recycling. To address this challenge, we have developed a strategy to coat oxygen nanobubbles with exosomes and incorporate them into a polyvinyl alcohol/gelatin hybrid hydrogel. This approach not only alleviates wound hypoxia but also offers an efficient means of delivering exosome-coated nanoparticles in hypoxic conditions. The self-healing properties of the hydrogel, along with its component, gelatin, aids in hemostasis, while its crosslinking bonds facilitate hydrogen peroxide decomposition, to ameliorate wound inflammation. Here, we show the potential of this multifunctional hydrogel for enhanced healing, promoting angiogenesis, facilitating exosome delivery, mitigating hypoxia, and inhibiting inflammation in a male rat full-thickness wound model.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodological development in a broad range of domains. In this rapidly evolving field, large number of methods are being reported using machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Majority of these models are inherently complex and lacks explanations of the decision making process causing these models to be termed as 'Black-Box'. One of the major bottlenecks to adopt such models in mission-critical application domains, such as banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and public services and safety, is the difficulty in interpreting them. Due to the rapid proleferation of these AI models, explaining their learning and decision making process are getting harder which require transparency and easy predictability. Aiming to collate the current state-of-the-art in interpreting the black-box models, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the explainable AI (XAI) models. To reduce false negative and false positive outcomes of these back-box models, finding flaws in them is still difficult and inefficient. In this paper, the development of XAI is reviewed meticulously through careful selection and analysis of the current state-of-the-art of XAI research. It also provides a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the XAI frameworks and their efficacy to serve as a starting point of XAI for applied and theoretical researchers. Towards the end, it highlights emerging and critical issues pertaining to XAI research to showcase major, model-specific trends for better explanation, enhanced transparency, and improved prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Within the vast expanse of computerized language processing, a revolutionary entity known as Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged, wielding immense power in its capacity to comprehend intricate linguistic patterns and conjure coherent and contextually fitting responses. Large language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that have emerged as powerful tools for a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and question-answering. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs, including their history, architecture, training methods, applications, and challenges. The paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of generative AI and the architecture of generative pre- trained transformers (GPT). It then provides an overview of the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper then discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including medical, education, finance, and engineering. It also discusses how LLMs are shaping the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.

        "title": "The GenAI is out of the bottle: generative artificial intelligence from a business model innovation perspective",
        "abstract": "Abstract The introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI has stimulated substantial discourse on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains such as academia, business, and society at large. Although AI has been utilized in numerous areas for several years, the emergence of generative AI (GAI) applications such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or DALL-E are considered a breakthrough for the acceleration of AI technology due to their ease of use, intuitive interface, and performance. With GAI, it is possible to create a variety of content such as texts, images, audio, code, and even videos. This creates a variety of implications for businesses requiring a deeper examination, including an influence on business model innovation (BMI). Therefore, this study provides a BMI perspective on GAI with two primary contributions: (1) The development of six comprehensive propositions outlining the impact of GAI on businesses, and (2) the discussion of three industry examples, specifically software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. This study employs a qualitative content analysis using a scoping review methodology, drawing from a wide-ranging sample of 513 data points. These include academic publications, company reports, and public information such as press releases, news articles, interviews, and podcasts. The study thus contributes to the growing academic discourse in management research concerning AI's potential impact and offers practical insights into how to utilize this technology to develop new or improve existing business models.",

        "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.",

        "abstract": "The stated goal of many organizations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), an imagined system with more intelligence than anything we have ever seen. Without seriously questioning whether such a system can and should be built, researchers are working to create \u201csafe AGI\u201d that is \u201cbeneficial for all of humanity.\u201d We argue that, unlike systems with specific applications which can be evaluated following standard engineering principles, undefined systems like \u201cAGI\u201d cannot be appropriately tested for safety. Why, then, is building AGI often framed as an unquestioned goal in the field of AI? In this paper, we argue that the normative framework that motivates much of this goal is rooted in the Anglo-American eugenics tradition of the twentieth century. As a result, many of the very same discriminatory attitudes that animated eugenicists in the past (e.g., racism, xenophobia, classism, ableism, and sexism) remain widespread within the movement to build AGI, resulting in systems that harm marginalized groups and centralize power, while using the language of \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cbenefiting humanity\u201d to evade accountability. We conclude by urging researchers to work on defined tasks for which we can develop safety protocols, rather than attempting to build a presumably all-knowing system such as AGI.",

Compared with synthetic drugs, natural products not only have diverse structures but also exhibit a range of biological activities against different disease states and molecular targets, making them attractive for development in the field of medicine. Despite advancements in the use of natural products for clinical purposes, there remain obstacles that hinder their full potential. These challenges include issues such as limited solubility and stability when administered orally, as well as short durations of effectiveness. To address these concerns, nano-drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising solution to overcome the barriers faced in the clinical application of natural products. These systems offer notable advantages, such as a large specific surface area, enhanced targeting capabilities, and the ability to achieve sustained and controlled release. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have provided further evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle-based systems in delivering natural products in preclinical disease models. This review describes the limitations of natural product applications and the current status of natural products combined with nanotechnology. The latest advances in nano-drug delivery systems for delivery of natural products are considered from three aspects: connecting targeting warheads, self-assembly, and co-delivery. Finally, the challenges faced in the clinical translation of nano-drugs are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Chitin and chitosan are biopolymers that are frequently found in nature and have a broad range of applications in the food, biomedical and industrial sectors, due to their high biological activity. The primary source of chitin and chitosan is shellfish, however, shortages in the supply chain, seasonality issues in their availability, as well as ecological degradation are only a few of the problems with the main chitin resources. Due to the broad spectrum of applications for which chitin can be used, the demand for chitin and its derivatives is increasing. Therefore, the market is looking for widely available, greener alternatives to the main commercial chitin sources. Insects appear as a suitable candidate to fill this gap. During insect rearing and processing, a number of side streams are generated, e.g., exuviae of larvae and pupae, dead adults, etc. which are currently mostly discarded as waste. However, these side streams could constitute a novel and long-term supply of chitin for industrial applications. Recent research has demonstrated the suitability of several edible insect species for the production of chitin and chitosan, wherein the exoskeleton of the black soldier fly and field cricket are rich in chitin, making them a good source for chitin and chitosan extraction and purification among other farmed insect candidates. Moreover, several potential uses have been identified for insect-derived chitin and chitosan. Thus, this review aims to present recent advances in the production of chitin and chitosan from edible insects, specifically on their extraction and purification, as well as on their applications for agriculture, food and nutrition, biomedicine and bioplastic production.",

        "abstract": "Throughout human history, agriculture has undergone a series of progressive transformations based on ever-evolving technologies in an effort to increase productivity and profitability. Over the years, farming methods have evolved significantly, progressing from Agriculture 1.0, which relied on primitive tools, to Agriculture 2.0, which incorporated machinery and advanced farming practices, and subsequently to Agriculture 3.0, which emphasized mechanization and employed intelligent machinery and technology to enhance productivity levels. To further automate and increase agricultural productivity while minimizing agricultural inputs and pollutants, a new approach to agricultural management based on the concepts of the fourth industrial revolution is being embraced gradually. This approach is referred to as \u201cAgriculture 4.0\u201d and is mainly implemented through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, enabling the remote control of sensors and actuators and the efficient collection and transfer of data. In addition, fueled by technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum sensing, and four-dimensional communication, a new form of smart agriculture, called \u201cAgriculture 5.0,\u201d is now emerging. Agriculture 5.0 can exploit the growing 5G network infrastructure as a basis. However, only 6G-IoT networks will be able to offer the technological advances that will allow the full expansion of Agriculture 5.0, as can be inferred from the relevant scientific literature and research. In this article, we first introduce the scope of Agriculture 5.0 as well as the key features and technologies that will be leveraged in the much-anticipated 6G-IoT communication systems. We then highlight the importance and influence of these developing technologies in the further advancement of smart agriculture and conclude with a discussion of future challenges and opportunities.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and especially reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to enable agents to learn and perform tasks autonomously with superhuman performance. However, we consider RL as fundamentally a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) paradigm, even when an agent eventually performs its task autonomously. In cases where the reward function is challenging or impossible to define, HITL approaches are considered particularly advantageous. The application of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in systems such as ChatGPT demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing for user experience and integrating their feedback into the training loop. In HITL RL, human input is integrated during the agent\u2019s learning process, allowing iterative updates and fine-tuning based on human feedback, thus enhancing the agent\u2019s performance. Since the human is an essential part of this process, we argue that human-centric approaches are the key to successful RL, a fact that has not been adequately considered in the existing literature. This paper aims to inform readers about current explainability methods in HITL RL. It also shows how the application of explainable AI (xAI) and specific improvements to existing explainability approaches can enable a better human-agent interaction in HITL RL for all types of users, whether for lay people, domain experts, or machine learning specialists. Accounting for the workflow in HITL RL and based on software and machine learning methodologies, this article identifies four phases for human involvement for creating HITL RL systems: (1) Agent Development, (2) Agent Learning, (3) Agent Evaluation, and (4) Agent Deployment. We highlight human involvement, explanation requirements, new challenges, and goals for each phase. We furthermore identify low-risk, high-return opportunities for explainability research in HITL RL and present long-term research goals to advance the field. Finally, we propose a vision of human-robot collaboration that allows both parties to reach their full potential and cooperate effectively.",

We find that students from the affected universities establish fewer AI startups and raise less funding. The brain\u2010drain effect is significant for tenured professors, professors from top universities, and deep\u2010learning professors. Additional evidence suggests that unobserved city\u2010 and university\u2010level shocks are unlikely to drive our results. We consider several economic channels for the findings. The most consistent explanation is that professors' departures reduce startup founders' AI knowledge, which we find is an important factor for successful startup formation and fundraising.",

To ensure the successful and equitable adoption of health technology innovations, engineers must think beyond the device and the direct end user and must seek a more holistic understanding of broader stakeholder needs and the intended context of use early in a design process. The objectives of this review article are ( a) to provide rationale for the need to incorporate meaningful stakeholder analysis and contextual investigation in health technology development and biomedical engineering pedagogy, ( b) to review existing frameworks and human- and equity-centered approaches to stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation for improved adoption of innovative technologies, and ( c) to present case studyexamples of medical device design that apply these approaches to bridge the gaps between biomedical engineers and the contexts for which they are designing.",

        "title": "Distinct GSDMB protein isoforms and protease cleavage processes differentially control pyroptotic cell death and mitochondrial damage in cancer cells",
        "abstract": "Abstract Gasdermin (GSDM)-mediated pyroptosis is functionally involved in multiple diseases, but Gasdermin-B (GSDMB) exhibit cell death-dependent and independent activities in several pathologies including cancer. When the GSDMB pore-forming N-terminal domain is released by Granzyme-A cleavage, it provokes cancer cell death, but uncleaved GSDMB promotes multiple pro-tumoral effects (invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance). To uncover the mechanisms of GSDMB pyroptosis, here we determined the GSDMB regions essential for cell death and described for the first time a differential role of the four translated GSDMB isoforms ( GSDMB1-4 , that differ in the alternative usage of exons 6-7) in this process. Accordingly, we here prove that exon 6 translation is essential for GSDMB mediated pyroptosis, and therefore, GSDMB isoforms lacking this exon ( GSDMB1-2 ) cannot provoke cancer cell death. Consistently, in breast carcinomas the expression of GSDMB2 , and not exon 6-containing variants ( GSDMB3-4 ), associates with unfavourable clinical-pathological parameters. Mechanistically, we show that GSDMB N-terminal constructs containing exon-6 provoke cell membrane lysis and a concomitant mitochondrial damage. Moreover, we have identified specific residues within exon 6 and other regions of the N-terminal domain that are important for GSDMB-triggered cell death as well as for mitochondrial impairment. Additionally, we demonstrated that GSDMB cleavage by specific proteases (Granzyme-A, Neutrophil Elastase and caspases) have different effects on pyroptosis regulation. Thus, immunocyte-derived Granzyme-A can cleave all GSDMB isoforms, but in only those containing exon 6, this processing results in pyroptosis induction. By contrast, the cleavage of GSDMB isoforms by Neutrophil Elastase or caspases produces short N-terminal fragments with no cytotoxic activity, thus suggesting that these proteases act as inhibitory mechanisms of pyroptosis. Summarizing, our results have important implications for understanding the complex roles of GSDMB isoforms in cancer or other pathologies and for the future design of GSDMB-targeted therapies.",
