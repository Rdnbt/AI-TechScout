        "abstract": "Abstract Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodological development in a broad range of domains. In this rapidly evolving field, large number of methods are being reported using machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Majority of these models are inherently complex and lacks explanations of the decision making process causing these models to be termed as 'Black-Box'. One of the major bottlenecks to adopt such models in mission-critical application domains, such as banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and public services and safety, is the difficulty in interpreting them. Due to the rapid proleferation of these AI models, explaining their learning and decision making process are getting harder which require transparency and easy predictability. Aiming to collate the current state-of-the-art in interpreting the black-box models, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the explainable AI (XAI) models. To reduce false negative and false positive outcomes of these back-box models, finding flaws in them is still difficult and inefficient. In this paper, the development of XAI is reviewed meticulously through careful selection and analysis of the current state-of-the-art of XAI research. It also provides a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the XAI frameworks and their efficacy to serve as a starting point of XAI for applied and theoretical researchers. Towards the end, it highlights emerging and critical issues pertaining to XAI research to showcase major, model-specific trends for better explanation, enhanced transparency, and improved prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have transformed healthcare. This study is based on a general literature review uncovering the role of AI in healthcare and focuses on the following key aspects: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics, (ii) virtual patient care, (iii) medical research and drug discovery, (iv) patient engagement and compliance, (v) rehabilitation, and (vi) other administrative applications. The impact of AI is observed in detecting clinical conditions in medical imaging and diagnostic services, controlling the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with early diagnosis, providing virtual patient care using AI-powered tools, managing electronic health records, augmenting patient engagement and compliance with the treatment plan, reducing the administrative workload of healthcare professionals (HCPs), discovering new drugs and vaccines, spotting medical prescription errors, extensive data storage and analysis, and technology-assisted rehabilitation. Nevertheless, this science pitch meets several technical, ethical, and social challenges, including privacy, safety, the right to decide and try, costs, information and consent, access, and efficacy, while integrating AI into healthcare. The governance of AI applications is crucial for patient safety and accountability and for raising HCPs\u2019 belief in enhancing acceptance and boosting significant health consequences. Effective governance is a prerequisite to precisely address regulatory, ethical, and trust issues while advancing the acceptance and implementation of AI. Since COVID-19 hit the global health system, the concept of AI has created a revolution in healthcare, and such an uprising could be another step forward to meet future healthcare needs.",

        "title": "A survey on deep learning tools dealing with data scarcity: definitions, challenges, solutions, tips, and applications",
        "abstract": "Abstract Data scarcity is a major challenge when training deep learning (DL) models. DL demands a large amount of data to achieve exceptional performance. Unfortunately, many applications have small or inadequate data to train DL frameworks. Usually, manual labeling is needed to provide labeled data, which typically involves human annotators with a vast background of knowledge. This annotation process is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Usually, every DL framework is fed by a significant amount of labeled data to automatically learn representations. Ultimately, a larger amount of data would generate a better DL model and its performance is also application dependent. This issue is the main barrier for many applications dismissing the use of DL. Having sufficient data is the first step toward any successful and trustworthy DL application. This paper presents a holistic survey on state-of-the-art techniques to deal with training DL models to overcome three challenges including small, imbalanced datasets, and lack of generalization. This survey starts by listing the learning techniques. Next, the types of DL architectures are introduced. After that, state-of-the-art solutions to address the issue of lack of training data are listed, such as Transfer Learning (TL), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Model Architecture (MA), Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), and Deep Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (DeepSMOTE). Then, these solutions were followed by some related tips about data acquisition needed prior to training purposes, as well as recommendations for ensuring the trustworthiness of the training dataset. The survey ends with a list of applications that suffer from data scarcity, several alternatives are proposed in order to generate more data in each application including Electromagnetic Imaging (EMI), Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Medical imaging, Meteorology, Wireless Communications, Fluid Mechanics, Microelectromechanical system, and Cybersecurity. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first review that offers a comprehensive overview on strategies to tackle data scarcity in DL.",

        "abstract": "The significant advancements in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to healthcare decision-making, medical diagnosis, and other domains have simultaneously raised concerns about the fairness and bias of AI systems. This is particularly critical in areas like healthcare, employment, criminal justice, credit scoring, and increasingly, in generative AI models (GenAI) that produce synthetic media. Such systems can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate existing inequalities, including generative biases that affect the representation of individuals in synthetic data. This survey study offers a succinct, comprehensive overview of fairness and bias in AI, addressing their sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies. We review sources of bias, such as data, algorithm, and human decision biases\u2014highlighting the emergent issue of generative AI bias, where models may reproduce and amplify societal stereotypes. We assess the societal impact of biased AI systems, focusing on perpetuating inequalities and reinforcing harmful stereotypes, especially as generative AI becomes more prevalent in creating content that influences public perception. We explore various proposed mitigation strategies, discuss the ethical considerations of their implementation, and emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure effectiveness. Through a systematic literature review spanning multiple academic disciplines, we present definitions of AI bias and its different types, including a detailed look at generative AI bias. We discuss the negative impacts of AI bias on individuals and society and provide an overview of current approaches to mitigate AI bias, including data pre-processing, model selection, and post-processing. We emphasize the unique challenges presented by generative AI models and the importance of strategies specifically tailored to address these. Addressing bias in AI requires a holistic approach involving diverse and representative datasets, enhanced transparency and accountability in AI systems, and the exploration of alternative AI paradigms that prioritize fairness and ethical considerations. This survey contributes to the ongoing discussion on developing fair and unbiased AI systems by providing an overview of the sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies related to AI bias, with a particular focus on the emerging field of generative AI.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrated extraordinary capability in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including language translation, text generation, question answering, etc. Moreover, LLMs are new and essential part of computerized language processing, having the ability to understand complex verbal patterns and generate coherent and appropriate replies in a given context. Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a plethora of research on LLMs have been appeared within a short time, it is quite impossible to track all of these and get an overview of the current state of research in this area. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLMs training phase. Then the paper provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper also demonstrates the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. The study also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Finally, the paper also explores open issues and challenges to deploy LLMs in real-world scenario. Our review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals.",

        "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in translating artificial intelligence (AI) research into clinically-validated applications to improve the performance, capacity, and efficacy of healthcare services. Despite substantial research worldwide, very few AI-based applications have successfully made it to clinics. Key barriers to the widespread adoption of clinically validated AI applications include non-standardized medical records, limited availability of curated datasets, and stringent legal/ethical requirements to preserve patients' privacy. Therefore, there is a pressing need to improvise new data-sharing methods in the age of AI that preserve patient privacy while developing AI-based healthcare applications. In the literature, significant attention has been devoted to developing privacy-preserving techniques and overcoming the issues hampering AI adoption in an actual clinical environment. To this end, this study summarizes the state-of-the-art approaches for preserving privacy in AI-based healthcare applications. Prominent privacy-preserving techniques such as Federated Learning and Hybrid Techniques are elaborated along with potential privacy attacks, security challenges, and future directions.",

The key component of FedALA is an Adaptive Local Aggregation (ALA) module, which can adaptively aggregate the downloaded global model and local model towards the local objective on each client to initialize the local model before training in each iteration. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedALA, we conduct extensive experiments with five benchmark datasets in computer vision and natural language processing domains. FedALA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 3.27% in test accuracy.

Synthetic data has shown promise in finance and economics to improve risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading. However, higher stakes, potential liabilities, and healthcare practitioner distrust make clinical use of synthetic data difficult. This paper explores the potential benefits and limitations of synthetic data in the healthcare analytics context. We begin with real-world healthcare applications of synthetic data that informs government policy, enhance data privacy, and augment datasets for predictive analytics. We then preview future applications of synthetic data in the emergent field of digital twin technology. We explore the issues of data quality and data bias in synthetic data, which can limit applicability across different applications in the clinical context, and privacy concerns stemming from data misuse and risk of re-identification. Finally, we evaluate the role of regulatory agencies in promoting transparency and accountability and propose strategies for risk mitigation such as Differential Privacy (DP) and a dataset chain of custody to maintain data integrity, traceability, and accountability. Synthetic data can improve healthcare, but measures to protect patient well-being and maintain ethical standards are key to promote responsible use.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought about tremendous possibilities, but at the same time, it has opened up new vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of connected systems. Developing a secure IoT ecosystem is a daunting challenge that requires a systematic and holistic approach to identify and mitigate potential security threats. Cybersecurity research considerations play a critical role in this regard, as they provide the foundation for designing and implementing security measures that can address emerging risks. To achieve a secure IoT ecosystem, scientists and engineers must first define rigorous security specifications that serve as the foundation for developing secure devices, chipsets, and networks. Developing such specifications requires an interdisciplinary approach that involves multiple stakeholders, including cybersecurity experts, network architects, system designers, and domain experts. The primary challenge in IoT security is ensuring the system can defend against both known and unknown attacks. To date, the IoT research community has identified several key security concerns related to the architecture of IoT systems. These concerns include issues related to connectivity, communication, and management protocols. This research paper provides an all-inclusive and lucid review of the current state of anomalies and security concepts related to the IoT. We classify and analyze prevalent security distresses regarding IoT\u2019s layered architecture, including connectivity, communication, and management protocols. We establish the foundation of IoT security by examining the current attacks, threats, and cutting-edge solutions.

        "title": "Bias and Unfairness in Machine Learning Models: A Systematic Review on Datasets, Tools, Fairness Metrics, and Identification and Mitigation Methods",
        "abstract": "One of the difficulties of artificial intelligence is to ensure that model decisions are fair and free of bias. In research, datasets, metrics, techniques, and tools are applied to detect and mitigate algorithmic unfairness and bias. This study examines the current knowledge on bias and unfairness in machine learning models. The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines and is registered on OSF plataform. The search was carried out between 2021 and early 2022 in the Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Google Scholar knowledge bases and found 128 articles published between 2017 and 2022, of which 45 were chosen based on search string optimization and inclusion and exclusion criteria. We discovered that the majority of retrieved works focus on bias and unfairness identification and mitigation techniques, offering tools, statistical approaches, important metrics, and datasets typically used for bias experiments. In terms of the primary forms of bias, data, algorithm, and user interaction were addressed in connection to the preprocessing, in-processing, and postprocessing mitigation methods. The use of Equalized Odds, Opportunity Equality, and Demographic Parity as primary fairness metrics emphasizes the crucial role of sensitive attributes in mitigating bias. The 25 datasets chosen span a wide range of areas, including criminal justice image enhancement, finance, education, product pricing, and health, with the majority including sensitive attributes. In terms of tools, Aequitas is the most often referenced, yet many of the tools were not employed in empirical experiments. A limitation of current research is the lack of multiclass and multimetric studies, which are found in just a few works and constrain the investigation to binary-focused method. Furthermore, the results indicate that different fairness metrics do not present uniform results for a given use case, and that more research with varied model architectures is necessary to standardize which ones are more appropriate for a given context. We also observed that all research addressed the transparency of the algorithm, or its capacity to explain how decisions are taken.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning is usually utilized as a fraud detection framework in the domain of financial risk management, which promotes the model accuracy without training data exchange. One of the challenges in federated learning is the GAN-based poisoning attack. The GAN-based poisoning attack is a type of intractable poisoning attack that causes global model accuracy degradation and privacy leak. Most of the existing defenses for GAN-based poisoning attack have the three problems: 1) dependence on validation datasets; 2) incompetence of dealing with incremental poisoning attack; and 3) privacy leak. To address the above problems, we present a privacy-aware and incremental defense (PID) method to detect malicious participants and protect privacy. In PID, we design a method to accumulate the offset of model parameters from participants in all current epochs to represent the moving tendency for model parameters. Thus, we can distinguish the adversaries from normal participants based on the accumulations in this incremental poisoning attack. We also use multiple trust domains to reduce the rate of misjudging benign participants as adversaries. Moreover, a differentiated differential privacy is utilized before the global model sending to protect the privacy of participants' training datasets in PID. The experiments conducted on two real-world datasets under financial fraud detection scenario demonstrate that the PID reduces the fallout of adversaries detection (the rate of misjudging benign participants as adversaries) by at least 51.1% and improve the speed of detecting all malicious participants by at least 33.4% compared with two popular defense methods. Besides, the privacy preserving of PID is also effective.",

        "abstract": "Envisioned to be the next-generation Internet, the metaverse has been attracting enormous attention from both the academia and industry. The metaverse can be viewed as a 3D immersive virtual world, where people use Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices to access and interact with others through digital avatars. While early versions of the metaverse exist in several Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, the full-flesh metaverse is expected to be more complex and enabled by various advanced technologies. Blockchain is one of the crucial technologies that could revolutionize the metaverse to become a decentralized and democratic virtual society with its own economic and governance system. Realizing the importance of blockchain for the metaverse, our goal in this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey that clarifies the role of blockchain in the metaverse including in-depth analysis of digital asset management. To this end, we discuss how blockchain can enable the metaverse from different perspectives, ranging from user applications to virtual services and the blockchain-enabled economic system. Furthermore, we describe how blockchain can shape the metaverse from the system perspective, including various solutions for the decentralized governance system and data management. The potential of blockchain for security and privacy aspects of the metaverse infrastructure is also figured out, while a full flow of blockchain-based digital asset management for the metaverse is investigated. Finally, we discuss a wide range of open challenges of the blockchain-empowered metaverse.",

AI is now used in a plethora of research areas and has demonstrated its capability to bring new approaches and solutions to various research problems. However, the extensive computation required to train AI algorithms comes with a cost. Driven by the need to reduce the energy consumption, the carbon footprint and the cost of computers running machine learning algorithms, TinyML is nowadays considered as a promising AI alternative focusing on technologies and applications for extremely low-profile devices. This paper presents the results of a literature survey of all TinyML applications and related research efforts. Our survey builds a taxonomy of TinyML techniques that have been used so far to bring new solutions to various domains, such as healthcare, smart farming, environment, and anomaly detection. Finally, this survey highlights the remaining challenges and points out possible future research directions. We anticipate that this survey will motivate further discussions on the various fields of applications of TinyML and the synergy of resource-constrained devices and edge intelligence.",

        "abstract": "The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has accelerated the development of several systems that are elicited from it. This boom has made the systems vulnerable to security attacks and allows considerable bias in order to handle errors in the system. This puts humans at risk and leaves machines, robots, and data defenseless. Trustworthy AI (TAI) guarantees human value and the environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art on how to build a Trustworthy and eXplainable AI, taking into account that AI is a black box with little insight into its underlying structure. The paper also discusses various TAI components, their corresponding bias, and inclinations that make the system unreliable. The study also discusses the necessity for TAI in many verticals, including banking, healthcare, autonomous system, and IoT. We unite the ways of building trust in all fragmented areas of data protection, pricing, expense, reliability, assurance, and decision-making processes utilizing TAI in several diverse industries and to differing degrees. It also emphasizes the importance of transparent and post hoc explanation models in the construction of an eXplainable AI and lists the potential drawbacks and pitfalls of building eXplainable AI. Finally, the policies for developing TAI in the autonomous vehicle construction sectors are thoroughly examined and eclectic ways of building a reliable, interpretable, eXplainable, and Trustworthy AI systems are explained to guarantee safe autonomous vehicle systems.",
