        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the disruptive potential to transform patients\u2019 lives via innovations in pharmaceutical sciences, drug development, clinical trials, and manufacturing. However, it presents significant challenges, ethical concerns, and risks across sectors and societies. AI\u2019s rapid advancement has revealed regulatory gaps as existing public policies struggle to keep pace with the challenges posed by these emerging technologies. The term AI itself has become commonplace to argue that greater \u201chuman oversight\u201d for \u201cmachine intelligence\u201d is needed to harness the power of this revolutionary technology for both potential and risk management, and hence to call for more practical regulatory guidelines, harmonized frameworks, and effective policies to ensure safety, scalability, data privacy, and governance, transparency, and equitable treatment. In this review paper, we employ a holistic multidisciplinary lens to survey the current regulatory landscape with a synopsis of the FDA workshop perspectives on the use of AI in drug and biological product development. We discuss the promises of responsible data-driven AI, challenges and related practices adopted to overcome limitations, and our practical reflections on regulatory oversight. Finally, the paper outlines a path forward and future opportunities for lawful ethical AI. This review highlights the importance of risk-based regulatory oversight, including diverging regulatory views in the field, in reaching a consensus.",

Traditional food systems struggle to adapt, necessitating innovative solutions and sustainable practices to meet future food demands. This review article explores emerging food system models and alternative food sources, including edible insects, seaweeds, plant-based and lab-cultured meats, underutilized crops, hydroponics, and next-generation fish farming. It highlights the role of food processing technologies such as blockchain, biotechnology, and robotics in enhancing sustainability, reducing waste, and improving food system efficiency. Consumer acceptance of engineered and fortified foods emerges as a critical factor in driving these innovations. The review also emphasizes the need for a transformative approach to food production, incorporating innovative technologies and sustainable practices to ensure food security by 2050. A coordinated effort to integrate alternate food sources and advanced processing methods will be vital for achieving a secure and sustainable global food future.",

        "title": "Regulating AI in the Energy Sector: A Scoping Review of EU Laws, Challenges, and Global Perspectives",
        "abstract": "Using the PRISMA-ScR methodology, this scoping review systematically analyzes how EU laws and regulations influence the development, adoption, and deployment of AI-driven digital solutions in energy generation, transmission, distribution, consumption, and markets. It identifies key regulatory barriers such as stringent risk assessments, cybersecurity obligations, and data access restrictions, along with enablers like regulatory sandboxes and harmonized compliance frameworks. Legal uncertainties, including AI liability and market manipulation risks, are also examined. To provide a comparative perspective, the EU regulatory approach is contrasted with AI governance models in the United States and China, highlighting global best practices and alignment challenges. The findings indicate that while the EU\u2019s risk-based approach to AI governance provides a robust legal foundation, cross-regulatory complexity and sector-specific ambiguities necessitate further refinement. This paper proposes key recommendations, including the integration of AI-specific energy sector guidelines, acceleration of standardization efforts, promotion of privacy-preserving AI methods, and enhancement of international cooperation on AI safety and cybersecurity. These measures will help strike a balance between fostering trustworthy AI innovation and ensuring regulatory clarity, enabling AI to accelerate the clean energy transition while maintaining security, transparency, and fairness in digital energy systems.",

        "abstract": "This article discusses the problems that arise and must be resolved in order to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of Chinese-brand automobile assembly in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is shown as a model of an oil-driven economy seeking industrial modernization and the most dynamic car assembly case in Central Asia in the past 5 years. Since the automotive industry development strategies in different countries have various specific characteristics and provide an overview of the main global and regional trends in the development of the automotive industry, the problems of industry development also leverage the accumulated experiences of different countries where government initiatives have fostered the growth of their domestic automotive industry. Although we use standard and well-proven methods of analysis, planning, and forecasting, the novelty of the approach lies in the fact that any new company entering the market and opening a new production facility should focus on maintaining the sustainability of the country\u2019s automotive industry within the framework of the adopted industry development strategy. We have developed such an algorithm for planning a strategy. The blend of traditional methodologies and their adaptation makes the suggested methodology new. We also considered the fact that, due to a lack of knowledge, there are significant challenges when determining whether localizing automobile components is feasible. An assessment of the prospects for the automotive industry in Kazakhstan based on data from open sourcesmade it possible to develop options for possible strategies from which the most appropriate one can be selected. The conclusion chapter presents findings, limitations of the study, and directions for future research. The use of this approach allows for considering the interplay of the factors at the stage of an industry development strategy emerging and establishing long-term plans that take into account the specific characteristics of Kazakhstan\u2019s development.",

        "title": "A Systematic Literature Review for Blockchain-Based Healthcare Implementations",
        "abstract": "Background: Healthcare information systems are hindered by delayed data sharing, privacy breaches, and lack of patient control over data. The growing need for secure, privacy-preserved access control interoperable in health informatics technology (HIT) systems appeals to solutions such as Blockchain (BC), which offers a decentralized, transparent, and immutable ledger architecture. However, its current adoption remains limited to conceptual or proofs-of-concept (PoCs), often relying on simulated datasets rather than validated real-world data or scenarios, necessitating further research into its pragmatic applications and their benchmarking. Objective: This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to analyze BC-based healthcare implementations by benchmarking peer-reviewed studies and turning PoCs or production insights into real-world applications and their evaluation metrics. Unlike prior SLRs focusing on proposed or conceptual models, simulations, or limited-scale deployments, this review focuses on validating practical BC real-world applications in healthcare settings beyond conceptual studies and PoCs. Methods: Adhering to PRISMA-2020 guidelines, we systematically searched five major databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect) for high-precision relevant studies using MeSH terms related to BC in healthcare. The designed review protocol was registered with OSF, ensuring transparency in the review process, including study screening by independent reviewers, eligibility, quality assessment, and data extraction and synthesis. Results: In total, 82 original studies fully met the eligibility criteria and narratively reported BC-based healthcare implementations with validated evaluation outcomes. These studies highlight the current challenges addressed by BC in healthcare settings, providing both qualitative and quantitative data synthesis on its effectiveness. Conclusions: BC-based healthcare implementations show both qualitative and quantitative effectiveness, with advancements in areas such as drug traceability (up to 100%) and fraud prevention (95% reduction). We also discussed the recent challenges of focusing more attention in this area, along with a discussion on the mythological consideration of our own work. Our future research should focus on addressing scalability, privacy-preservation, security, integration, and ethical frameworks for widespread BC adoption for data-driven healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Cold atmospheric plasmas (CAPs) within recent years have shown great promise in the field of plasma medicine, encompassing a variety of treatments from wound healing to the treatment of cancerous tumors. For each subsequent treatment, a different application of CAPs has been postulated and attempted to best treat the target for the most effective results. These treatments have varied through the implementation of control parameters such as applied settings, electrode geometries, gas flow, and the duration of the treatment. However, with such an extensive number of variables to consider, scientists and engineers have sought a means to accurately control CAPs for the best-desired effects in medical applications. This paper seeks to investigate and characterize the historical precedent for the use of plasma control mechanisms within the field of plasma medicine. Current control strategies, plasma parameters, and control schemes will be extrapolated through recent developments and successes to gain better insight into the future of the field and the challenges that are still present in the overall implementation of such devices. Proposed approaches, such as data-driven machine learning, and the use of closed-loop feedback controls, will be showcased as the next steps toward application.",

        "title": "Comprehensive comparison of egg yolk of three Korean native chicken varieties: physicochemical quality, antioxidant activity, and flavor-related substances",
        "abstract": "Agriculture has played a significant role in the national economy, contributing to food security, driving economic growth, and safeguarding the dietary habits of the population. Korean agriculture has been compelled to focus on intensive farming due to its limited cultivation area, excessive input costs, and the limitations of agricultural mechanization. In the Republic of Korea (R.O.K), the concept of environmentally friendly animal agriculture began to be introduced in the early 2000s. This concept ultimately aims to cultivate sustainable animal agriculture (SAA) through environmentally friendly production practices, ensuring the healthy rearing of animals to supply safe animal products. Despite the government's efforts, there are still significant challenges in implementing environmentally friendly agriculture and SAA in the R.O.K. Therefore, the objective of this review is to establish the direction that the animal agriculture sector should take in the era of climate crisis, and to develop effective strategies for SAA tailored to the current situation in the R.O.K by examining the trends in SAA in the U.S. The animal agriculture sector in the U.S. has been working towards creating a SAA system where humans, animals, and the environment can coexist through government initiatives, industry research, technological support, and individual efforts. Efforts have been made to reduce emissions like carbon, and improve factors affecting the environment such as the carbon footprint, odor, and greenhouse gases associated with animal agriculture processes for animals such as cattle and pigs. The transition of the U.S. towards SAA appears to be driven by both external goals related to addressing climate change and the primary objectives of responding to the demand for safe animal products, expanding consumption, and securing competitiveness in overseas export markets. The demand for animal welfare, organic animal products, and processed goods has been increasing in the U.S. consumer market. A major factor in the transformation of the U.S. animal agriculture sector in terms of livestock specifications is attributed to environmentally friendly practices such as high-quality feed, heat stress reduction, improvements in reproductive ability and growth period reduction, and efforts in animal genetic enhancement.",

        "abstract": "Innovation ecosystems often face challenges such as inadequate coordination, insufficient protection of intellectual property, limited access to quality expertise, and inefficient matchmaking between innovators and experts. This paper provides an in-depth design analysis of SPARK-IT, a novel business innovation platform specifically addressing these challenges. The platform leverages advanced AI to precisely match innovators with suitable mentors, supported by a distributed web scraper that constructs expert profiles from reliable sources (e.g., LinkedIn and BrainMap). Data privacy and security are prioritized through robust encryption that restricts sensitive content exclusively to innovators and mentors, preventing unauthorized access even by platform administrators. Additionally, documents are stored encrypted on decentralized storage, with their cryptographic hashes anchored on blockchain to ensure transparency, traceability, non-repudiation, and immutability. To incentivize active participation, SPARK-IT utilizes a dual-token approach comprising reward and reputation tokens. The reward tokens, SparkCoins, are wrapped stablecoins with tangible monetary value, enabling seamless internal transactions and external exchanges. Finally, the paper discusses key design challenges and critical architectural trade-offs and evaluates the socio-economic impacts of implementing this innovative solution.",

        "abstract": "Transnational entrepreneurs with technological know-how have been promoted by the Chinese state and academic literature as a central force for regional development of industrial competitiveness. But what motivates them, and what do they experience and aspire to when building a start-up in China? This book answers these questions by examining how socially privileged entrepreneurial talents adopt and champion the \"\"wolf culture\"\" \u2013 a fast-paced, competitive, and aspirational work culture \u2013 that has become prevalent since China's mass promotion of entrepreneurship and innovation. Based on extensive field research, including participant observation and interviews in Shenzhen's high-tech industry, this book challenges the popular notion of entrepreneurship as entirely self-initiated and passion-driven. Outlining the concrete instruments of governance of the local state, the author argues that transnational talent from elite schools or elite professions is often \"\"entrepreneured\"\" in China. Moreover, she argues that the different standards of selection of entrepreneurial talents by state and market actors create localised precarious conditions for them. This book offers fascinating insights into the contradictions inherent in the Chinese model of entrepreneurship. Start-up Wolf will appeal to scholars and students of China studies, the anthropology of entrepreneurship, science and technology studies, and economic geography, as well as business practitioners interested in innovation and high-tech start-ups.",

        "abstract": "The cultural and creative industries have emerged as significant drivers of economic growth and national competitiveness in the 21st century. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the role that cultural industries \u2013 including sectors such as film, music, publishing, design, digital arts, and more \u2013 play in enhancing a nation\u2019s economic performance and global standing. Drawing on a wide range of scholarly and institutional sources, the study examines how cultural industries contribute to innovation and knowledge creation, generate employment (especially for youth and women), expand exports and diversify trade, and bolster a country\u2019s soft power and international influence. The Introduction frames the importance of cultural industries in the global economy, while the Literature Review synthesizes key findings from prior research and policy reports. A Theoretical Framework is outlined to connect concepts of competitiveness, innovation systems, and soft power to cultural industry development. The Methodology section explains the qualitative research approach used. In the Analysis, we detail the multi-faceted contributions of cultural industries: as catalysts of innovation and creativity, as creators of jobs and skills, as sources of export revenues and trade competitiveness, and as instruments of soft power that enhance national brand value. The Discussion reflects on the implications of these findings, highlighting the synergistic effects of cultural industries on economic resilience, innovation ecosystems, and global influence, as well as policy considerations for nurturing these sectors. The article concludes that integrating cultural industries into national economic strategies yields not only direct economic benefits in terms of GDP and trade but also strategic advantages in innovation capacity and geopolitical influence. These insights underscore the need for policymakers to view the cultural sector not merely as entertainment or heritage, but as a pivotal component of sustainable economic development and global competitiveness.",

        "abstract": "A high-level pr\u00e9cis of the Technical Paper can be found in the Summary for Policymakers report, Generative AI in Electoral Campaigns: Mapping Global Patterns. GenAI is being deployed in many ways during elections, ranging from the creation of deepfake video and audio messages, to sophisticated voter targeting. What are the implications of GenAI for election administration and voter participation around the world? This assessment delivers the first global, data-driven analysis of its kind, designed to inform policy recommendations that enhance election administration, foster trust in electoral processes, and boost voter turnout. Based on an analysis of an original data set of 215 incidents, covering all 50 countries holding competitive national elections in 2024, we find that: Fully four-fifths (80%) of the countries holding elections in 2024 had GenAI incidents. The vast majority (90%) of incidents involved content creation, such as audio messages, images, videos, and social media posts. Almost half of the incidents have no known source (46%), a quarter were produced by political candidates and parties (25%), a fifth were produced by foreign actors (20%), and the remainder came from other sources (9%). More than two-thirds (69%) of the incidents were described as having a harmful role in the election.",

        "abstract": "India is one of the fastest growing major economies and is currently ranked as the world\u2019s sixth largest economy. Projections of growth, over the medium term, remain encouraging and optimistic for India. The underlying strengths are indicative of the potential of India to achieve a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025. The current structure of the economy and the emerging dynamics provide us grounds to target achieving 1 trillion dollar from agriculture and allied activities, 1 trillion from manufacturing and 3 trillion from services. On 15th August 2019, delivering his 6th Independence Day Speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed confidence that India would be a $5-trillion economy in 2024. More recently, speaking at a function to mark 100 years of ASSOCHAM in New Delhi on 20.12.2019, Prime Minister Modi said that BJP-led government has given the country a solid foundation so that it can achieve its target to be US $5 trillion economy by 2025. So that, the country has made itself so strong in the last five years that we can set such targets and achieve them too, Earlier, in July 2019, the Economic Survey laid out a blueprint for $5 Trillion India economy. The Economic Survey 2019 presented by Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian focuses on moving to a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d of savings, investments and exports to transform India into a $5 trillion economy in the next five years. For the same, the Government of India has several ongoing initiatives across sectors focused on growth. In agriculture the Government is aiming to reorient policy focus from being production-centric to becoming income centric. The emphasis on incomes provides a broader scope towards achieving the needed expansion of the sector. The proposed Industrial Policy 2018 provides an overarching, sector-agnostic agenda for the enterprises of the future and envisions creating a globally competitive Indian industry that is modern, sustainable and inclusive. However, there are challenges before the vision of 5trillon Economy. As a commerce and management experts, the academia have to identify and assess the challenges and hindrance slowdown India\u2019s move towards the 5 trillion USD Economy, and find a roadmap to achieve India\u2019s vision 5 trillion USD Economy. Hence, the present seminar has proposed to collect experts\u2019 opinion to support India\u2019s 5 trillion vision.",

Adopting a neoclassical geopolitics approach \u2013recognizing the interplay of material capabilities and ideational factors \u2013, this article examines how geopolitical narratives regarding digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), reflect and shape this competition. It proposes three heuristic \u201cgeopolitical narratives\u201d grounded in international relations theories: a \u201cclosed world\u201d narrative (realism), emphasizing security and sovereignty; an \u201copen world\u201d narrative (liberalism), focusing on cooperation and multilateral governance; and a \u201cworld of injustices\u201d narrative (critical theories), highlighting global inequalities and digital divides. Through a qualitative content analysis of political speeches by Joe Biden and Xi Jinping (2018-2023), the study reveals how these leaders strategically deploy narratives to justify policies, promote interests, and influence global AI discourses. The findings underscore the bidirectional nature of narratives, which both reflect and shape strategic objectives and policy decisions. This article contributes to understanding how narratives influence global AI governance, highlighting their role in shaping international alliances and technological norms amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the intersection of Asia's blockchain industry and special economic zones (SEZs). SEZs have been promoted to localise blockchain technology by disparate actors from cyberlibertarian figures to Asian blockchain firms, national policymakers, and local politicians. This convergence raises questions about what activities are imagined for Asian blockchain zones and what mutations of sovereignty, markets, and democracy they involve? To answer, this article surveys how zones have been imagined for blockchain and examines the case of Korea's Busan Blockchain Regulation\u2010Free Zone (BBRFZ). We discuss competing imaginaries that shape the project, from the laissez\u2010faire fantasy of Busan as a cryptocurrency hub to more \u201cdevelopmentalist\u201d ideas for the zone. We argue that despite its invocation of freedom, the BBRFZ is animated by an anxious regulatory dynamic: one that seeks to promote blockchain as a means for regional development but remains conflicted due to the risks that cyberlibertarian logics of exception might bring.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of the ZEB Horizon RT portable mobile laser scanner (MLS) in simulating silvicultural thinning operations across three different Tuscan forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.), and Stone pine (Pinus pinea L.). The aim is to compare the efficiency and accuracy of the MLS with traditional dendrometric methods. The study established three marteloscopes, each covering a 50 m \u00d7 50 m plot area (0.25 ha). Traditional dendrometric methods involved a team georeferencing trees using a total station and measuring the diameter at breast height (DBH) and selected tree heights (H) to calculate the growing stock volume (GSV). The MLS survey was carried out by a two-person team, who processed the point cloud data with LiDAR 360 software to automatically identify the tree positions, DBH, and H. The methods were compared based on the time, cost, and simulated felling volume. The MLS method was more time-efficient, saving nearly one and a half hours per marteloscope, equivalent to EUR 170. This advantage was most significant in denser stands, especially the Italian cypress forest. Both methods were comparable in terms of accuracy for Douglas-fir and Stone pine stands, with no significant differences in felling number or volume, although greater differences were noted for the Italian cypress forest.",

        "title": "Opportunities for Latecomer Technological Catch\u2010up in the Era of Renewables Capitalism: Possible Pathways out of the Periphery",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Debate section asks whether developing countries can leverage the transition to renewables capitalism to escape their peripheral status in the global economy. This contribution focuses on how capitalism, and thus also renewables capitalism, creates windows of opportunity during periods of disruptive technological change and how latecomer countries can exploit these windows for technological catch\u2010up; it suggests possible pathways out of the periphery that have been downplayed or overlooked in the development studies literature. The authors argue that successfully leveraging windows of opportunity requires three interconnected dynamics: (1) local firms must access and assimilate foreign knowledge through transnational networks; (2) firms must use this knowledge base for innovation while securing adequate market demand and financing to scale production and reduce costs; and (3) governments must provide strategic support through targeted industrial policies. The article makes a novel contribution to the debate on technological catch\u2010up in development studies by demonstrating that all three dynamics are not only important but necessary for technological catch\u2010up. It illustrates this argument through two industry case studies from the more distant past (South Korea and Taiwan in semiconductors) and the more recent past (China in electric vehicles). Its insights can inform strategies regarding the windows of opportunity related to green decarbonization technologies which will inevitably arise under renewables capitalism.",

The Global Findex 2025 reports that 58% of adults in low- and middle-income economies hold digital accounts, with 42% using digital payments, a 20% rise since 2021. Super apps like M-Pesa and Grab integrate payments, lending, and e-commerce, serving millions, while blockchain and stablecoins facilitate $670 billion in remittances, cutting costs by up to 60%. AI personalizes services, disbursing $2 billion in microloans, and enhances fraud detection, reducing losses by 40%. However, challenges persist: only 30% of rural Sub-Saharan Africa has internet access, data costs remain high, and 50% of mobile users skip security measures, contributing to $50 billion in fraud losses. Regulatory fragmentation and low financial literacy (40% literacy rate) limit adoption. Policy recommendations include expanding connectivity through public-private partnerships, harmonizing regulations via sandboxes, scaling literacy programs, and fostering inclusive policies. By addressing these barriers, emerging markets can unlock DFS\u2019s potential, ensuring equitable access and economic empowerment by 2025",

The main risk is that information and assessments not included in the Strategy and left to be confirmed and managed at later stages have the potential to negatively affect the successful implementation of the Digital Transformation, therefore, negating the sought after business benefits. To mitigate this risk, this article proposes DigStratCon, a Digital or Technology Strategy Framework that generalises the digital Transformation detaching it from its specific functional application, such as marketing, products, Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). Therefore, DigStratCon applies to any area within an organisation or infrastructure including Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). DigStratCon defines seven key components within a Digital or Technology Strategy, specifically 1) Market research, 2) Digital vision, 3) Current state, 4) Roadmap, 5) Risks, 6) Enablers, and finally 7) Supply Chain. A qualitative analysis of several United Kingdom (UK) government digital strategies assesses their completeness against the DigStratCon model. On average, UK digital strategies score 6/7 being innovative and ambitious in their vision; however, they generally lack a common or standardised structure and wider international benchmark and alignment.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the world of finance and investments has changed, considering measures related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors for socially responsible investments. ESG scoring and ratings are used to estimate ESG risk. This book presents ESG ratings and scorings and their providers and lists problems with data quality, data sources, and unknown methodology, contributing to the green- and social-washing ESG rating phenomenon. The value of assets invested in green instruments relies on high-quality ESG ratings to measure green transition. Data greenwashing negatively impacts the financial market, especially the stock price, fund activities, and bond markets. The size of the rated company, geographical location, and industry biases are considered in understanding the greenwashing phenomenon. This book illustrates all the problems related to ESG rating inflation, conflicts of interest, models of payment, and internal and external ratings. It describes current regulations, initiatives, and practical knowledge of ESG scoring. Academics and students of financial law, economics, and financial sustainability will find this book invaluable. The practical implications in the book will benefit sustainability-concerned regulators and practitioners who estimate ESG risk (especially in financial institutions).

It situates supply chain governance within the broader regulatory and economic debates of this special issue, which addresses digital transformation and legal coordination in the region. The article argues that multilateral economic forums shape supply chain stability through trade policy, investment frameworks, and industrial coordination, complementing regional agreements such as ASEAN, IPEF, and RCEP. Japan\u2019s semiconductor policy serves as a case study to demonstrate how national strategies interact with global governance structures from both policy and legal perspectives. The analysis shows that supply chain resilience cannot be addressed solely through national or regional policies. Multilateral coordination is necessary to mitigate economic disruptions, geopolitical risks, and regulatory fragmentation. This supports the special issue\u2019s focus on regulatory alignment in the Indo-Pacific, highlighting supply chains as a critical yet underexplored foundation of digital economic governance.",

        "title": "Innovations in marine biodiversity monitoring using small unmanned underwater vehicles: ROVs &amp; AUVs",
        "abstract": "Monitoring is an essential component within the field of marine ecological research to help understand and manage marine ecosystems. The rapid developments in offshore wind energy and infrastructure, marine aquaculture, and nature conservation and restoration efforts, has driven a growing demand for marine ecology data to evaluate their impact and/or effectiveness. Traditional monitoring methods include for instance diver inspection, ship-based side-scan sonar and multibeam or use of industrial (work-class) Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). These methods work well, but are often very costly. Rapid advancements in small handheld Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), along with innovations in sensor and remote grab technologies, have the potential to create new marine monitoring possibilities. UUVs, often described as mobile platforms, come in various forms. This report focuses on inspection-class ROVs and smaller Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Gliders and Extra Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (XLUUVs) are not included in the scope of this report, as their operation requires more specialized resources and infrastructure. Compared to work-class ROVs and larger AUVs, these smaller vehicles are lighter, easier to operate, and typically do not require launch systems. They also do not need large specialized vessels making deployment more flexible while reducing operational and monitoring costs. Equipped with add-ons such as robotic arms and diverse sensor types, these platforms can offer accessible and cost-effective monitoring solutions, even in challenging environments. Despite their potential, the full range of applications for these platforms remains largely unexplored in marine research. Therefore, this report examines available technologies, sensors, and UUVs, alongside case studies, user perspectives, and operational challenges to support the development of effective monitoring frameworks. Furthermore, the report includes a brief introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Computer Vision (CV) techniques, to illustrate how optical (video, photo, sonar, etc.) imagery from UUVs can be analysed. The goal of this project is to provide an up-to-date overview of innovative tools available for habitat mapping and biodiversity monitoring using: \u2022 Handheld UUVs: inspection-class ROVs and small AUVs \u2022 Sensors and acoustic techniques that can be mounted on mobile platforms \u2022 Artificial Intelligence: Computer Vision A general overview of inspection-class ROVs and small AUVs is provided in this report. We do not attempt to compare the various models of ROVs and AUVs, since many can do similar tasks and can be customised by adding add-ons such as sensors (e.g., cameras and sonar) or robot-arms. Therefore this report includes a chapter on add-ons with links to technical specifications on the manufacturers websites. Furthermore, since a lot of monitoring requires some form of data processing using AI, a small overview is given of the various options for image analysis. The practical use of ROVs and AUVs for ecological monitoring is demonstrated by a step-by-step approach presented in different user cases about monitoring biogenic and geogenic reefs in the North Sea, coral reefs in the Caribbean, artificial reefs and Nature Inclusive Designs (NIDs), and aquaculture. The annexes provide technical specifications of small ROVs and AUVs.",

        "abstract": "Until now, research has been performed mainly in men, with a low recruitment of women; consequentially, biological, physiological, and physio-pathological mechanisms are less understood in women. Obviously, without data obtained on women, it is impossible to apply the results of research appropriately to women. This issue also applies to medical devices (MDs), and numerous problems linked to scarce pre-market research and clinical trials on MDs were evidenced after their introduction to the market. Globally, some MDs are less efficient in women than in men and sometimes MDs are less safe for women than men, although recently there has been a small but significant decrease in the sex and gender gap. As an example, cardiac resynchronization defibrillators seem to produce more beneficial effects in women than in men. It is also important to remember that MDs can impact the health of healthcare providers and this could occur in a sex- and gender-dependent manner. Recently, MDs\u2019 complexity is rising, and to ensure their appropriate use they must have a sex\u2013gender-sensitive approach. Unfortunately, the majority of physicians, healthcare providers, and developers of MDs still believe that the human population is only constituted by men. Therefore, to overcome the gender gap, a real collaboration between the inventors of MDs, health researchers, and health providers should be established to test MDs in female and male tissues, animals, and women.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The integration of care and social robots in aged care offers a promising solution to the increasing global challenges posed by an ageing population and caregiver shortages. While these robots have demonstrated promising outcomes in enhancing emotional wellbeing and social interactions among older adults, there are legitimate concerns regarding the ethical implications, particularly regarding dignity, privacy, and autonomy. Furthermore, marginalised groups, such as LGBT+ older adults, which face existing disparities in old age are at risk of exclusion in the implementation of social robots in aged care. To better account for the diverse set of stakeholder values within the social robot ecosystem, this study applies a value sensitive design approach to a case study: social robot interventions to address the problem of loneliness in the older LGBT+ community. It aims to understand the values of LGBT+ older adults relating to the design of social robots intended to alleviate loneliness and explore emerging value sensitive robot design recommendations. To that end, 33 semi-structured interviews were conducted with LGBT+ older adults, healthcare professionals and LGBT+ ageing service providers, and robot experts. Using reflexive thematic analysis, this study identifies three themes\u2014care values, social values, and community values\u2014and 16 values relevant to the design of social robots for LGBT+ older adults. Further, this study contributes practical, value sensitive design recommendations for social robots in this context, as they emerge from the findings.",

Clinical utility was defined by psychometric and clinimetric criteria. 85 eligible studies were identified from 89 publications. Twenty-eight distinct postural outcome tools plus bespoke measures were identified. Most tools were sophisticated computer-based electronic devices or complex time-consuming questionnaires, with limited applicability in non-occupational settings. Clinical utility domains most achieved were construct validity and inter/intra-rater reliability. Tools being underpinned by the biopsychosocial model of pain, sensitivity to clinical change, and predictive validity were the least achieved. Tools had limited clinical utility and were based on postural-structural-biomechanical pain model. </ns3:p>",

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is a technology that creates objects by adding successive layers of material. The 3D method is an alternative to subtractive production, in which production involves removing material from the initial solid. 3D printing requires the initial design of the manufactured object using computer design, for example, one of the following programs: CAD, 3DCrafter, Wings 3D, Cinema 3, Blender, 3ds Max, Autodesk Inventor, and others. It is also possible to scan an existing object to be manufactured using 3D printing technology. An important element of Industry 5.0 is 3D printing technology, due to its favorable environmental orientation and production flexibility. Three-dimensional printing technology uses recycled materials such as powders. Therefore, it can be part of a circular economy, contributing to environmental protection. Additive manufacturing not only complements existing technologies by enabling rapid prototyping but also plays a fundamental role in sectors such as dentistry and medicine. This article consists of seven chapters relating to various aspects of 3D printing technology in the context of the assumptions and challenges of Industry 5.0. It examines the environmental impact and recycling potential of 3D printing technology, illustrates the economic integration of this technology within various industries, and discusses its future development prospects.",

        "abstract": "Robots are a key digital production technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In 2020, China accounted for one third of all industrial robots in operation globally. The emerging literature has mainly focused on the effects of robotization, while evidence on its drivers and spatial diffusion remain limited. We address this gap by producing new evidence on the complex mix of structural and policy factors driving fast robotization across China and its regions. We identify three \u2018structural drivers\u2019 of robotization \u2013 demand pull, supply push and capability preconditions \u2013 and study the resulting spatial dynamics of technology adoption. We find significant heterogeneity in robots\u2019 adoption across regions and sectors, in robots manufacturing and technological capabilities. Furthermore, we highlight the key role of a fourth \u2018policy driver\u2019 \u2013 industrial policy \u2013 and conduct an in-depth analysis of robotization policies at the national and province levels since 2016. We identify four main robotizing regional hubs in China \u2013 Guangdong, Yangtze-River-Delta, Beijing-Tianjin and Jilin-Liaoning. We finally analyse three emerging policy interfaces linking Made in China 2025 (within which China\u2019s robotization policy is framed) and the Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 that is, opening markets, shaping industry and standards, and directing finance. With this new multi-scalar industrial policy configuration, China is further reshaping the domestic and international political economy of robotization, ultimately moving the country ahead in the digital technology race.",

Leading global companies are harnessing innovative technologies such as internet of things, big data, artificial intelligence, robotics and digital twin to revolutionize manufacturing process. This transformation is resulting in the creation of new business models and value-added products. It is time to shift the paradigm of trade by reforming the old mindset dominated by tangible goods. While current trade agreements contain some rules on digital trade, the scope of discussions lag behind the business reality of industrial digital transformation. This article purports to rebuild the objectives and priorities of global digital trade negotiations, by reflecting recent hyper-connectivity and hyper-intelligence.

        "abstract": "Numerous concerns associated with the use of synthetic pesticides have led to important initiatives aimed at ensuring eco-friendly practices in pest and disease control. Third-generation pesticides, biopesticides, have become a key factor in those efforts, capturing the attention of researchers worldwide. To evaluate trends in biopesticide research over the past three decades, a bibliometric analysis was performed on bibliographic data sourced from the Web of Science database. This analysis included metrics such as publication dynamics, types of documents, and assessments of research fields and categories. Co-authorship, citation, and co-occurrence networks were visualized using VOSviewer software to identify collaboration patterns, influential publications, emerging topics, and interdisciplinary connections. A total of 5054 publications on the topic of \u2018biopesticide\u2019 were found (1994\u20132024), nearly half of which were published in the last five years. Out of 136 contributing countries, researchers from the USA, People\u2019s Republic of China, and India produced the most publications, while a total of 19,676 authors contributed to at least one paper throughout the entire examined period. The identification of the most frequently used keywords highlighted significant topics within biopesticide-related publications, from the earliest to the most recent, aiding in our understanding of the developmental trajectory and opportunities for future exploration.",

        "title": "Fashion 4.0 and emerging designers: <i>leveraging data and AI to drive creativity, innovation and compliance in global supply chain regulation</i>",
        "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents three interrelated arguments concerning the fashion industry and regulation. First, we propose that Bertola\u2019s and Teunissen\u2019s concept of Fashion 4.0 offers a powerful framework for understanding the organization of global fashion today. This model emphasizes the dynamic, decentralized and technology-driven character of the \u2018smart factories\u2019, \u2018smart networks\u2019 and \u2018smart products\u2019 that dominate the global fashion industry. The value of this framework is illustrated with contemporary examples from the UK. Second, we argue that increasing regulatory demands impose uncertain and costly compliance obligations on firms across multiple aspects of their operations and supply chain. Our discussion highlights the confluence of challenges related to intellectual property, value chain monitoring and AI regulation. We contend that smaller and medium-sized enterprises, particularly emerging designers, are disproportionately affected by this regulatory burden\u2014a phenomenon we term the \u2018tragic character\u2019 of contemporary compliance. Finally, we explore how the challenge of navigating an increasingly complex business and regulatory landscape necessitates the deployment of ever-more sophisticated digital technologies, especially AI. We outline several potential applications of such technologies across the fashion industry. In conclusion, we suggest that in the context of Fashion 4.0, understanding the interaction between different regulatory schemes, as well as their effects on industry stakeholders, is becoming critical yet increasingly complex and opaque. This raises difficult questions about the limits of law and other regulatory schemes in fostering innovative, sustainable, and socially responsible business practices in the fashion sector.",

        "title": "Precision Fermentation as a Tool for Sustainable Cosmetic Ingredient Production",
        "abstract": "Precision fermentation, a highly controlled process of microbial fermentation, is emerging as a transformative tool to produce cosmetic ingredients. This technology leverages engineered micro-organisms to produce high-value compounds with applications in skincare, hair care, and other cosmetic formulations. Unlike traditional methods of ingredient sourcing, which often rely on extraction from plants or animals, precision fermentation offers a sustainable and scalable alternative, minimizing environmental impact and enhancing the consistency of ingredient supply. This paper explores the potential of precision fermentation to revolutionize the cosmetic industry by enabling the production of complex molecules, such as peptides, proteins, and other bioactive compounds, which are essential for cosmetic efficacy. Using synthetic biology, micro-organisms such as yeast, bacteria, and fungi are programmed to biosynthesize specific cosmetic ingredients, which can include antioxidants, emulsifiers, and moisturizers. This technique not only ensures high purity and ingredients safety but also allows for the production of novel compounds that may be difficult or impossible to obtain through traditional methods. Furthermore, precision fermentation can be employed to address growing consumer demand for cruelty-free, vegan, and eco-friendly products, as it eliminates the need for animal-derived ingredients and reduces resource consumption associated with conventional farming and extraction processes. This review highlights key advancements in the field, discussing the challenges faced by industry, such as regulatory framework, and presents potential solutions for overcoming these obstacles. The paper concludes by examining the prospects of precision fermentation in cosmetics, forecasting how continued innovation in this area could further drive sustainability, ethical production practices, and the development of highly functional, scientifically advanced cosmetic products.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the implementation of interconnected intelligent systems in extremely dynamic contexts with limited resources. However, traditional paradigms, such as those using ECC-based heuristics and centralised decision-making frameworks, cannot be modernised to ensure resilience, scalability and security while taking quantum threats into account. In this case, we propose a modular architecture that integrates quantum-inspired cryptography (QI), epistemic uncertainty reasoning, the multiscale blockchain MuReQua, and the quantum-inspired decentralised storage engine (DeSSE) with fragmented entropy storage. Each component addresses specific cybersecurity weaknesses of IoT devices: quantum-resistant communication on epistemic agents that facilitate cognitive decision-making under uncertainty, lightweight adaptive consensus provided by MuReQua, and fragmented entropy storage provided by DeSSE. Tested through simulations and use case analyses in industrial, healthcare and automotive networks, the architecture shows exceptional latency, decision accuracy and fault tolerance compared to conventional solutions. Furthermore, its modular nature allows for incremental integration and domain-specific customisation. By adding reasoning, trust and quantum security, it is possible to design intelligent decentralised architectures for resilient IoT ecosystems, thereby strengthening system defences alongside architectures. In turn, this work offers a specific architectural response and a broader perspective on secure decentralised computing, even for the imminent advent of quantum computers.",

        "title": "Essays on Internationalization in Modern Capitalism: The Issues of Knowledge Intensity, Chinese MNEs, Digitalization, and Foreign Market Entry Strategies",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this modern capitalistic world, globalization facilitates economic and cultural connectivity, driven by innovation, digitalization, and the internationalization of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Digital technologies enable rapid information exchange and business model innovation. Emerging markets, characterized by economic growth, provide substantial opportunities for foreign direct investment, market expansion, and knowledge acquisition, reshaping the global economy. MNEs, influenced by advanced knowledge, capital input, and foreign entry strategies, significantly enhance globalization. However, globalization also intensifies global competition and opens discussions on the impact of emerging economies, geopolitical disputes, technological advancements, and changing consumer preferences. Therefore, I conducted four empirical studies (from Chapters 2 to 5) to explore the complex nature of firm internationalization. As China aims to become an innovation-driven economy, research on the knowledge management of Chinese MNEs has surged over the past 15 years. Chapter 2 develops a conceptual framework highlighting key factors in knowledge management, organized into six topical clusters and three evolutionary phases. Drawing from 150 articles in top business and management journals, I synthesize and integrate these insights. Additionally, I identify future research avenues, including shifting from knowledge exploitation to exploration and examining knowledge management trends in the digital era. Chapter 3 examines the global success of TikTok, developed by ByteDance, attributing its achievement to business model innovation strategies. TikTok successfully integrates aspects of various social networking and video-sharing platforms, offering a unique customer experience. Additionally, ByteDance leverages its extensive and diverse domestic market to test and refine TikTok's core technologies before expanding internationally. Digital products like apps can enter foreign markets with lower marginal and distribution costs, enjoying nearly instant global accessibility. Chapter 4 uses machine learning and traditional regression to examine the impact of international diversification on digital products' global performance. This study analyzes 117,535 apps from the Google Play Store, spanning 2005 to 2020. It also presents a conceptual framework that integrates insights from human knowledge and machine learning algorithms. Chapter 5 utilized machine learning techniques, specifically interpretable machine learning metrics, to compare various theories in international business. The aim was to address the issue of theories evolving independently without sufficient cross-theory analysis and relying heavily on self-references. Analyzing 62 variables related to the FDI strategies of 2,124 Japanese multinational companies, the study examined a large dataset of 96,803 observations across subsidiary activities from 2008 to 2017 in over 70 countries. This study identified key theories concerning FDI modes, highlighting both successful and unsuccessful strategies, and revealed previously overlooked variables for potential future exploration in research. This dissertation contributes to the field of internationalization by emphasizing innovation capability, competitive advantage, and the development of an international knowledge base through continual globalization. It is influenced by strategic assets, advanced knowledge resource-seeking motives, persistence in business models and technological innovation, and the accumulation of experience with globalization. Additionally, the dissertation offers several interesting future research avenues to advance international business research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Hybrid bonding is an important interconnect technology for heterogeneous integration. As the wafer-to-wafer hybrid bonding is extending toward chip-to-wafer bonding for better yield and versatility of chiplets integration, various issues have been raised on top of those for wafer-to-wafer hybrid bonding. A few key applications to be potentially benefited by high density chip-to-wafer hybrid bonding are first overviewed. Progress would not have been made without the great support of the industry at all levels, but manufacturing challenges are yet to be overcome as addressed by a few examples in this overview. These challenges include but not limited to establishing package platforms up to 3.5D package, fabricating hybrid bonded integrated chiplets from mixed nodes and different foundries by manufacturers, enabling high accuracy bonding overlay and reticle stitching, upgrading equipment for bonding thin chiplets, developing materials and processing technology to support lateral expansion of interposer size and vertical expansion of the multilayer stacking, and improving the understanding of hybrid bonding mechanisms impacted by various dielectric materials and surface activation processes. Nevertheless, the system technology co-optimization should always be conducted to minimize the warpage, reduce thermal impacts, and achieve the desired yield and reliability lifetime.",

        "abstract": "Indonesia could transform the manufacturing industry by making Indonesia 4.0, despite the many uncertainties of implementing Industry 4.0 due to high investment costs and unclear returns. Therefore, looking at neighboring countries such as Germany, the country that initiated Industry 4.0, and China, the country taking the lead in implementing Industry 4.0, it is considered essential for the manufacturing industry in Indonesia to understand how towards the revolution and identify the development of the Industry 4.0 program. Germany is confident in its capabilities in the field of manufacturing technology. It makes the main challenge in carrying out Industry 4.0 'Investment Capital, Employee Qualifications, and Security of Data Transfer and Legislation'. On the other hand, China faces significant challenges in Manufacturing Capabilities, Research and Development (R&amp;D), and Human Capital. To adopt the transformation technology and self-assess the internal resources, Indonesia created a tool, namely the Indonesia Industry 4.0 Readiness Index (INDI 4.0). This article presents a comparative review of the Industry 4.0 readiness index from the perspective of Germany and Singapore as a developed country compared to developing countries such as China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This study aims to provide awareness related to the readiness index, which can be used to inform industries whether they are suitable for applying Industry 4.0 and how to measure whether their employees are capable of it. In general, the INDI 4.0 measuring instrument shows the readiness of companies in Indonesia, and according to the recent assessment, the industries in Indonesia are at a moderate level, especially in the field of technology application and operation.",
