        "abstract": "Abstract The present discussion examines the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings, focusing on the necessity for AI literacy, prompt engineering proficiency, and enhanced critical thinking skills. The introduction of AI into education marks a significant departure from conventional teaching methods, offering personalized learning and support for diverse educational requirements, including students with special needs. However, this integration presents challenges, including the need for comprehensive educator training and curriculum adaptation to align with societal structures. AI literacy is identified as crucial, encompassing an understanding of AI technologies and their broader societal impacts. Prompt engineering is highlighted as a key skill for eliciting specific responses from AI systems, thereby enriching educational experiences and promoting critical thinking. There is detailed analysis of strategies for embedding these skills within educational curricula and pedagogical practices. This is discussed through a case-study based on a Swiss university and a narrative literature review, followed by practical suggestions of how to implement AI in the classroom.",

        "abstract": "This research paper intends to provide real-life applications of Generative AI (GAI) in the cybersecurity domain. The frequency, sophistication and impact of cyber threats have continued to rise in today&#x2019;s world. This ever-evolving threat landscape poses challenges for organizations and security professionals who continue looking for better solutions to tackle these threats. GAI technology provides an effective way for them to address these issues in an automated manner with increasing efficiency. It enables them to work on more critical security aspects which require human intervention, while GAI systems deal with general threat situations. Further, GAI systems can better detect novel malware and threatening situations than humans. This feature of GAI, when leveraged, can lead to higher robustness of the security system. Many tech giants like Google, Microsoft etc., are motivated by this idea and are incorporating elements of GAI in their cybersecurity systems to make them more efficient in dealing with ever-evolving threats. Many cybersecurity tools like Google Cloud Security AI Workbench, Microsoft Security Copilot, SentinelOne Purple AI etc., have come into the picture, which leverage GAI to develop more straightforward and robust ways to deal with emerging cybersecurity perils. With the advent of GAI in the cybersecurity domain, one also needs to take into account the limitations and drawbacks that such systems have. This paper also provides some of the limitations of GAI, like periodically giving wrong results, costly training, the potential of GAI being used by malicious actors for illicit activities etc.",

In this paper, we review recent research that has compared result patterns from silicon and human samples, finding that results vary considerably across different domains.

As we highlight in this paper, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation that could indeed be put to good use in the medical field. We also present the main architectures of these models, such as GPT, Bloom, or LLaMA, composed of billions of parameters. We then examine recent trends in the medical datasets used to train these models. We classify them according to different criteria, such as size, source, or subject (patient records, scientific articles, etc.). We mention that LLMs could help improve patient care, accelerate medical research, and optimize the efficiency of healthcare systems such as assisted diagnosis. We also highlight several technical and ethical issues that need to be resolved before LLMs can be used extensively in the medical field. Consequently, we propose a discussion of the capabilities offered by new generations of linguistic models and their limitations when deployed in a domain such as healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Chain-of-thought prompting enhances the abilities of large language models (LLMs) significantly. It not only makes these models more specific and context-aware but also impacts the wider field of artificial intelligence (AI). This approach broadens the usability of AI, increases its efficiency, and aligns it more closely with human thinking and decision-making processes. As we improve this method, it is set to become a key element in the future of AI, adding more purpose, precision, and ethical consideration to these technologies. In medicine, the chain-of-thought prompting is especially beneficial. Its capacity to handle complex information, its logical and sequential reasoning, and its suitability for ethically and context-sensitive situations make it an invaluable tool for healthcare professionals. Its role in enhancing medical care and research is expected to grow as we further develop and use this technique. Chain-of-thought prompting bridges the gap between AI\u2019s traditionally obscure decision-making process and the clear, accountable standards required in healthcare. It does this by emulating a reasoning style familiar to medical professionals, fitting well into their existing practices and ethical codes. While solving AI transparency is a complex challenge, the chain-of-thought approach is a significant step toward making AI more comprehensible and trustworthy in medicine. This review focuses on understanding the workings of LLMs, particularly how chain-of-thought prompting can be adapted for nephrology\u2019s unique requirements. It also aims to thoroughly examine the ethical aspects, clarity, and future possibilities, offering an in-depth view of the exciting convergence of these areas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), its potential implications for higher education have become a focal point of interest. This study delves into the capabilities of AI in physics education and offers actionable AI policy recommendations. Using openAI\u2019s flagship gpt-3.5-turbo large language model (LLM), we assessed its ability to answer 1337 physics exam questions spanning general certificate of secondary education (GCSE), A-Level, and introductory university curricula. We employed various AI prompting techniques: Zero Shot, in context learning, and confirmatory checking, which merges chain of thought reasoning with reflection. The proficiency of gpt-3.5-turbo varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an overall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique. In a separate test, the LLM\u2019s accuracy on 5000 mathematical operations was found to be 45.2%. When evaluated as a marking tool, the LLM\u2019s concordance with human markers averaged at 50.8%, with notable inaccuracies in marking straightforward questions, like multiple-choice. Given these results, our recommendations underscore caution: while current LLMs can consistently perform well on physics questions at earlier educational stages, their efficacy diminishes with advanced content and complex calculations. LLM outputs often showcase novel methods not in the syllabus, excessive verbosity, and miscalculations in basic arithmetic. This suggests that at university, there\u2019s no substantial threat from LLMs for non-invigilated physics questions. However, given the LLMs\u2019 considerable proficiency in writing physics essays and coding abilities, non-invigilated examinations of these skills in physics are highly vulnerable to automated completion by LLMs. This vulnerability also extends to pysics questions pitched at lower academic levels. It is thus recommended that educators be transparent about LLM capabilities with their students, while emphasizing caution against overreliance on their output due to its tendency to sound plausible but be incorrect.",

        "abstract": "The Metaverse technology (MVTECH) is an immersive virtual sphere where people interact with each other via avatars. The MVTECH promised to provide a number of potentials for various sectors including higher education. Despite the fact that MVTECH promotes virtual social interaction between people (e.g., university students), there is a lack of knowledge on what affects users\u2019 perceptions regarding its social sustainability in HEIs, specifically in developing nations. Therefore, this research paper aims to determine the variables that affect the learners\u2019 perceptions toward social sustainability (SS) of MVTECH in higher educational institutions (HEIs) in Jordan. A study model was formulated by integrating the core factors of the \u201cunified theory of acceptance and use of technology\u201d (UTAUT) (\u201cperformance expectancy, PE; effort expectancy, EE; social influence, SI; and facilitating conditions, FC\u201d) with \u201cperceived curiosity\u201d (PC) and \u201cextraversion\u201d (EXT) factors. Both PC and EXT were included as context-related variables that may possibly contribute to enhancing the applicability of UTAUT to a wide range of information technologies and settings. Data were collected from 422 students enrolled in Jordanian universities based on an online survey. The analysis of the \u201cstructural equation modeling\u201d (SEM) found that students\u2019 perceptions toward Metaverse were significantly influenced by PE, FC, and EXT. Furthermore, the PC construct significantly affected the EE construct. However, EE and SI were revealed to have no significant impact on SS. Drawing from these results, the study makes a number of theoretical advances and clarifies a number of practical implications for those involved in the development, design, and decision-making processes that support the use of the Metaverse in HEIs.",

Traditional detection methods, including rule-based approaches, metadata analysis, and human fact-checking, have been employed to combat disinformation, but these methods often fall short in the face of increasingly sophisticated fake content. This review article explores the emerging role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the detection of fake news and fake profiles. We provide a comprehensive overview of the nature and spread of disinformation, followed by an examination of existing detection methodologies. The article delves into the capabilities of LLMs in generating both fake news and fake profiles, highlighting their dual role as both a tool for disinformation and a powerful means of detection. We discuss the various applications of LLMs in text classification, fact-checking, verification, and contextual analysis, demonstrating how these models surpass traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, the article covers LLM-based detection of fake profiles through profile attribute analysis, network analysis, and behavior pattern recognition. Through comparative analysis, we showcase the advantages of LLMs over conventional techniques and present case studies that illustrate practical applications. Despite their potential, LLMs face challenges such as computational demands and ethical concerns, which we discuss in more detail. The review concludes with future directions for research and development in LLM-based fake news and fake profile detection, underscoring the importance of continued innovation to safeguard the authenticity of online information.",

In this study, we compared several cutting-edge deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), hybrid CNN-LSTM, Multilayer Perceptron\u2019s, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to project COVID-19 cases in the aforementioned regions. These models were calibrated and evaluated using a comprehensive dataset that includes confirmed case counts, demographic data, and relevant socioeconomic factors. To enhance the performance of these models, Bayesian optimization techniques were employed. Subsequently, the models were re-evaluated to compare their effectiveness. Analytic approaches, both predictive and retrospective in nature, were used to interpret the data. Our primary objective was to determine the most effective model for predicting COVID-19 cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Malaysia. The findings indicate that the selected deep learning algorithms were proficient in forecasting COVID-19 cases, although their efficacy varied across different models. After a thorough evaluation, the model architectures most suitable for the specific conditions in the UAE and Malaysia were identified. Our study contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, providing crucial insights into the application of sophisticated deep learning algorithms for the precise and timely forecasting of COVID-19 cases. These insights hold substantial value for shaping public health strategies, enabling authorities to develop targeted and evidence-based interventions to manage the virus spread and its impact on the populations of the UAE and Malaysia.

        "abstract": "This paper examines how the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology can enable autonomous AI agents to engage and execute economic and financial transactions. We critically examine the constraints on AI agents in achieving predefined objectives independently, especially due to their limited access to economic and financial institutions. We argue that AI\u2019s access to these institutions is vital in enhancing its capabilities to augment human productivity. Drawing on the theory of institutional economics, we propose that blockchain provides a solution for creating digital economic and financial institutions, permitting AI to engage with these institutions through the management of private keys. This extends AI\u2019s capabilities to form and execute contracts, participate in marketplaces, and utilize financial services autonomously. The paper encourages further research on AI as a general-purpose technology and blockchain as an institutional technology that can unlock the full capabilities of autonomous AI agents.",

        "abstract": "Digital twins are a powerful consequence of digital transformation. In fact, they have been applied to many industries to enhance operations, predict needs, improve decision making, or optimize performance, even though the definition of digital twins is still evolving. However, their impact on the software industry is still limited. Thus, this work aims to analyze the current adoption of digital twins in the software industry as a potential path to integrate them into application lifecycle management. To achieve this objective, first, the significant characteristics of current digital twins are analyzed in their application to manufacturing to understand how the knowledge and the lessons learned can be transferred to the software industry. Second, a systematic literature review was conducted on Scopus, the Web of Science, and the ScienceDirect database. The literature review revealed 93 documents after data screening and cleaning 251 initial documents. Our main findings are that digital twins are already influencing and will significantly affect the software industry, revolutionizing various aspects of the software development lifecycle. This study tackles what identifies a digital twin in the software industry, the specific domains and areas where they can be applied in the software lifecycle, and the proposed approaches explored to build digital twins for developing, deploying, and maintaining software systems. Finally, this study proposes some guidelines for building digital twins in the context of application lifecycle management. Determining an appropriate roadmap shortly is essential to achieve a widespread applicability to building suitable digital twins and preparing organizations for the software industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study utilizes advanced artificial intelligence techniques to analyze the social media behavior of 1358 users on VK, the largest Russian online social networking service. The analysis comprises 753,252 posts and reposts, combined with Big Five personality traits test results, as well as assessments of verbal and fluid intelligence. The objective of this research is to understand the manifestation of psychological attributes in social media users' behavior and determine their implications on user-interaction models. We employ the integrated gradients method to identify the most influential feature groups. The partial dependence plot technique aids in understanding how these features function across varying severity degrees of the predicted trait. To evaluate feature stability within the models, we cluster calculated Shapley values. Our findings suggest that the emotional tone (joy, surprise, anger, fear) of posts significantly influences the prediction of three personality traits: Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness to Experience. Additionally, user social engagement metrics (such as friend count, subscribers, likes, views, and comments) correlate directly with the predicted level of Logical thinking. We also observe a trend towards provocative and socially reprehensible content among users with high Neuroticism levels. The theme of religion demonstrates a multidirectional relationship with Consciousness and Agreeableness. Further findings, including an analysis of post frequency and key text characteristics, are also discussed, contributing to our understanding of the complex interplay between social media behavior and psychological traits. The study proposes a transition from the analysis of correlations between psychological (cognitive) traits to the analysis of indicators of behavior in a social network that are significant for diagnostic models of the corresponding traits.",

        "abstract": "The construction industry has endured high incident rates for many decades. Although multiple safety measures in the form of Safety I- and II-enabled safe systems of working (SSoWs) have been implemented, statistics reveal that a significant prevalence of incidents prevails worldwide. However, there is limited information available about the actual factors that are impeding these SSoWs. This study investigates and evaluates the barriers, bottlenecks and challenges (BB&amp;Cs) that hinder the implementation of Safety I- and II-enabled SSoWs in the construction industry. Using a scoping review methodology, a thorough search of articles documenting the BB&amp;Cs of implementing Safety I- and II-enabled SSoWs was carried out using Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. An initiative model was employed for categorising BB&amp;C to implement Safety I and II, which includes micro- (site), meso- (organisation), and macro (environment)-thematic groupings, as a guiding framework for the mapping and analysis of results. The search yielded 98 articles that discussed the implementation of Safety I and II, with 54 of them specifically related to BB&amp;Cs. Emergent results emphasised how there is scant literature on the BB&amp;Cs of implementation Safety I- and II-enabled SSoWs across site, organisation and environment levels. Extensive global research is necessary to comprehensively understand the obstacles to implementing Safety I and II in practice as a first step towards reducing incidents and accidents on site. Cumulatively, the findings suggest that implementing Safety I- and II-enabled SSoWs should be based on removing BB&amp;Cs and evaluating how they affect safety performance.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we explore explicit Large Language Model (LLM)-powered support for the iterative design of computer programs. Program design, like other design activity, is characterized by navigating a space of alternative problem formulations and associated solutions in an iterative fashion. LLMs are potentially powerful tools in helping this exploration; however, by default, code-generation LLMs deliver code that represents a particular point solution. This obscures the larger space of possible alternatives, many of which might be preferable to the LLM's default interpretation and its generated code. We contribute an IDE that supports program design through generating and showing new ways to frame problems alongside alternative solutions, tracking design decisions, and identifying implicit decisions made by either the programmer or the LLM. In a user study, we find that with our IDE, users combine and parallelize design phases to explore a broader design space -- but also struggle to keep up with LLM-originated changes to code and other information overload. These findings suggest a core challenge for future IDEs that support program design through higher-level instructions given to LLM-based agents: carefully managing attention and deciding what information agents should surface to program designers and when.",

        "abstract": "Since Facebook was renamed Meta, a lot of attention, debate, and exploration have intensified about what the Metaverse is, how it works, and the possible ways to exploit it. It is anticipated that Metaverse will be a continuum of rapidly emerging technologies, usecases, capabilities, and experiences that will make it up for the next evolution of the Internet. Several researchers have already surveyed the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications in realizing the Metaverse. However, due to the rapid emergence and continuous evolution of technologies, there is a need for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of the role of AI, 6G, and the nexus of both in realizing the immersive experiences of Metaverse. Therefore, in this survey, we first introduce the background and ongoing progress in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR) and spatial computing, followed by the technical aspects of AI and 6G. Then, we survey the role of AI in the Metaverse by reviewing the state-of-the-art in deep learning, computer vision, and Edge AI to extract the requirements of 6G in Metaverse. Next, we investigate the promising services of B5G/6G towards Metaverse, followed by identifying the role of AI in 6G networks and 6G networks for AI in support of Metaverse applications, and the need for sustainability in Metaverse. Finally, we enlist the existing and potential applications, usecases, and projects to highlight the importance of progress in the Metaverse. Moreover, in order to provide potential research directions to researchers, we underline the challenges, research gaps, and lessons learned identified from the literature review of the aforementioned technologies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Advanced persistent threats (APTs) pose significant security-related challenges to organizations owing to their sophisticated and persistent nature, and are inimical to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information and services. This study systematically reviews the literature on methods of detecting APTs by comprehensively surveying research in the area, identifying gaps in the relevant studies, and proposing directions for future work. The authors provide a detailed analysis of current methods of APT detection that are based on multi-stage attack-related behaviors. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted an extensive search of a variety of databases. A total of 45 studies, encompassing sources from both academia and the industry, were considered in the final analysis. The findings reveal that APTs have the capability to laterally propagate and achieve their objectives by identifying and exploiting existing systemic vulnerabilities. By identifying shortcomings in prevalent methods of APT detection, we propose integrating the multi-stage attack-related behaviors of APTs with the assessment of the presence of vulnerabilities in the network and their susceptibility to being exploited in order to improve the accuracy of their identification. Such an improved approach uses vulnerability scores and probability metrics to determine the probable sequence of targeted nodes, and visualizes the path of APT attacks. This technique of advanced detection enables the early identification of the most likely targets, which, in turn, allows for the implementation of proactive measures to prevent the network from being further compromised. The research here contributes to the literature by highlighting the importance of integrating multi-stage attack-related behaviors, vulnerability assessment, and techniques of visualization for APT detection to enhance the overall security of organizations.",

        "abstract": "Today, LLMs are not good at personalization providing recommendation. They advise physicians and financial advisors to ask professionals in respective fields for help, even having user information available. Answering questions of software professionals, LLM needs to deliver in-depth answers with codes or algorithms, whereas for professionals in other fields would need definitions and main concepts. The intent of this chapter is to make LLM answer tailored to the needs of users, taking into account available information about them. To do that, we need to generalize available information about a person like her health record, maintaining the privacy of this person. We rely on meta-learning techniques to design a LLM prompt to produce a personalization prompt to obtain a suitable relevant information. Such &amp;ldquo;meta-prompt&amp;rdquo; is produced by generalization operation applied to available documents for the user. These documents need to be de-identified so that they are sufficient for personalization on one hand and will maintain user privacy on the other hand. The second neuro-symbolic technique to support personalization is abductive reasoning, acting in parallel to LLM fine-tuning. Traditional recommendation and personalization techniques as well as modern, deep learning &amp;ndash; based are presented, and the comparison is drawn to the proposed approach. We also share the evaluation and comparative analyses of these approaches. We consider an example for how to build personalization LLM systems coming from Langchain platform. We will explore how to construct chains to form a personalization profile for a user and apply it to user search and recommendation requests.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Digital transformation and the possibility to collect large amount of data, the so-called big data, from different sources can lead to the redefinition of business processes, models and infrastructures. In this respect, data-driven decision making (DDDM) emphasizes the need to rethink management practices to view data as a driving force that can improve the effectiveness of decisions and nurture innovation. Over time, data-driven principles have been reframed as the foundations for the development of a new mind-set that considers data as a key asset that redesigns entrepreneurship and encompasses orientation, culture and human resources management to help entrepreneurs catch, evaluate and launch entrepreneurial opportunities that can improve technology and knowledge by stimulating innovation. For this reason, the study aims at reconceptualizing entrepreneurship according to a multi-levelled perspective based on the integration of cultural, human, knowledge-based and technological dimension to assess the impact of data-driven management on entrepreneurial opportunities creation and on the development of different kinds of innovation. To assess these goals, empirical research based on constructivist grounded theory and on the administration of semi-structured interviews is performed through the investigation of an Italian public\u2013private Consortium specialized in big data. The findings allow the elaboration of a conceptual framework which classifies the activities of data-driven entrepreneurial processes, the phases of opportunity creation and the different kinds of innovation enabled in the Consortium by guiding entrepreneurs and managers in the elaboration of effective data analysis strategies.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are creating a new paradigm for materials science by transforming textual insights into experimental findings. Leveraging their strengths in natural language understanding, multimodal alignment, and few\u2010shot reasoning, LLMs already show potential in property prediction, synthesis planning, and uncertainty quantification. This perspective highlights four key roles, Oracle, Surrogate, Quant, and Arbiter, to systematize recent advancements of LLMs in knowledge extraction, property inference, risk assessment, and decision\u2010making. Experience suggests that true value arises from integrating these capabilities into a verifiable, traceable loop rather than merely scaling model size. However, LLMs still face challenges due to data heterogeneity, limited interpretability, hallucination control, and misalignment with scientific tasks. To address these issues, we propose three forward\u2010looking directions: developing domain\u2010adapted foundation models infused with materials science context, establishing a standardized cross\u2010modal data infrastructure, and incorporating expert feedback alongside robotic automated experimentation into a fully traceable research loop. Through enhanced human\u2013AI collaboration and methodological innovation, LLMs can transform from general\u2010purpose language tools into scientifically aware partners, advancing materials discovery toward a more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable future.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques play a pivotal role in optimizing wireless communication networks. However, traditional deep learning approaches often act as closed boxes, lacking the structured reasoning abilities needed to tackle complex, multi-step decision problems. This survey provides a comprehensive review and outlook of reasoning-enabled AI in wireless communication networks, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and other advanced reasoning paradigms. In particular, LLM-based agents can combine reasoning with long-term planning, memory, tool utilization, and autonomous cross-layer control to dynamically optimize network operations with minimal human intervention. We begin by outlining the evolution of intelligent wireless networking and the limitations of conventional AI methods. We then introduce emerging AI reasoning techniques. Furthermore, we establish a classification system applicable to wireless network tasks. We also present a layer-by-layer examination for AI reasoning, covering the physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers. For each part, we identify key challenges and illustrate how AI reasoning methods can improve AI-based wireless communication performance. Finally, we discuss key research directions for AI reasoning toward future wireless communication networks. By combining insights from both communications and AI, this survey aims to chart a path for integrating reasoning techniques into the next-generation wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "This exploratory study envisions zero-carbon, sustainable hub-scale airports 50 years into the future. Our approach developed future scenarios that were framed by hypothetical levels and impacts of varied levels of future global temperature change (+1\u00b0C, +2\u00b0C, +4\u00b0C), and integrated energy generation, distribution, fuels, infrastructure, and human factors to envision three possible future states. We used backcasting methodologies by working backward from 2075 scenarios to identify the critical developments and decision points that could lead to each outcome combined with forecasting methodologies for the next ~25 years. Despite aviation's contribution to global carbon emissions, existing roadmaps to zero-carbon aviation are not presently implemented. This study also combines forecasting with backcasting methods to chart pathways to these envisioned airports, considering various Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal (PESTEL) factors. Key aspects of a future state, such as green hydrogen, multiple approaches to renewable energy, significant infrastructure changes, substantial lifecycle carbon dioxide (CO2) reductions, and others, are highlighted as essential elements of a multi-fuel approach for sustainable aviation. Based on the core understanding of the available power alternatives, the three scenarios examine future PESTEL pathways. Specifically, the three scenarios represent distinctly different visions of airport operations in 2075, each shaped by varying assumptions about technological progress, climate impacts, and societal adaptation. While all three scenarios acknowledge the fundamental role of global temperature change, they diverge significantly on its impact and in how humanity responds to this challenge.",

This thesis investigates the critical role of decentralized governance and the influence of national legal frameworks, as interpreted and implemented at the local level, in fostering a vibrant startup ecosystem in regions beyond the capital, with a specific case study of Sylhet Division. It argues that while national policies provide a foundational legal structure, genuine decentralization, characterized by empowered local governments with financial autonomy and tailored policy implementation, is crucial for addressing unique regional challenges and leveraging local opportunities to cultivate sustainable entrepreneurial growth. This research will explore the existing governance structures, relevant legal instruments, prevalent challenges, and inherent opportunities within Sylhet, ultimately proposing a comprehensive set of recommendations for policymakers to strategically nurture its burgeoning startup scene, contributing to a more equitable and inclusive national economic development.",

        "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Since Facebook was renamed Meta, a lot of attention, debate, and exploration have intensified about what the Metaverse is, how it works, and the possible ways to exploit it. It is anticipated that Metaverse will be a continuum of rapidly emerging technologies, usecases, capabilities, and experiences that will make it up for the next evolution of the Internet. Several researchers have already surveyed the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications in realizing the Metaverse. However, due to the rapid emergence and continuous evolution of technologies, there is a need for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of the role of AI, 6G, and the nexus of both in realizing the immersive experiences of Metaverse. Therefore, in this survey, we first introduce the background and ongoing progress in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR) and spatial computing, followed by the technical aspects of AI and 6G. Then, we survey the role of AI in the Metaverse by reviewing the state-of-the-art in deep learning, computer vision, and Edge AI to extract the requirements of 6G in Metaverse. Next, we investigate the promising services of B5G/6G towards Metaverse, followed by identifying the role of AI in 6G networks and 6G networks for AI in support of Metaverse applications, and the need for sustainability in Metaverse. Finally, we enlist the existing and potential applications, usecases, and projects to highlight the importance of progress in the Metaverse. Moreover, in order to provide potential research directions to researchers, we underline the challenges, research gaps, and lessons learned identified from the literature review of the aforementioned technologies.",

        "abstract": "The stated goal of many organizations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), an imagined system with more intelligence than anything we have ever seen. Without seriously questioning whether such a system can and should be built, researchers are working to create \u201csafe AGI\u201d that is \u201cbeneficial for all of humanity.\u201d We argue that, unlike systems with specific applications which can be evaluated following standard engineering principles, undefined systems like \u201cAGI\u201d cannot be appropriately tested for safety. Why, then, is building AGI often framed as an unquestioned goal in the field of AI? In this paper, we argue that the normative framework that motivates much of this goal is rooted in the Anglo-American eugenics tradition of the twentieth century. As a result, many of the very same discriminatory attitudes that animated eugenicists in the past (e.g., racism, xenophobia, classism, ableism, and sexism) remain widespread within the movement to build AGI, resulting in systems that harm marginalized groups and centralize power, while using the language of \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cbenefiting humanity\u201d to evade accountability. We conclude by urging researchers to work on defined tasks for which we can develop safety protocols, rather than attempting to build a presumably all-knowing system such as AGI.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The present study addresses two critical controversies surrounding the emerging Industry 5.0 agenda. Firstly, it seeks to elucidate the driving forces behind the accelerated momentum of the Industry 5.0 agenda amidst the ongoing digital industrial transformation. Secondly, it explores how the agenda\u2019s sustainability values can be effectively realised. The study conducted a comprehensive content-centric literature synthesis and identified how Industry 4.0 shortcomings adversely impacted sustainability values. Furthermore, the study implements a novel approach that determines how and in what order the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 should be leveraged to promote the sustainability objectives of Industry 5.0. Results reveal that Industry 4.0 has benefited economic and environmental sustainability values most at the organisational and supply chain levels. Nonetheless, most micro and meso-social sustainability values have been adversely impacted by Industry 4.0. Similarly, Industry 4.0 has been worryingly detrimental to macro sustainability values like social or economic growth equality. These contradictory implications of Industry 4.0 have pulled the Industry 5.0 agenda. However, the results identified nine sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 that, when leveraged appropriately and in the correct order, can offer important implications for realising the economic and socio-environmental goals of Industry 5.0. For example, under extreme unpredictability of business world uncertainties, the business should first leverage the automation and integration capabilities of Industry 4.0 to gain the necessary cost-saving, resource efficiency, risk management capability, and business antifragility that allow them to introduce sustainable innovation into their business model without jeopardising their survival. Various scenarios for empowering Industry 5.0 sustainability values identified in the present study offer important implications for knowledge and practice.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and especially reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to enable agents to learn and perform tasks autonomously with superhuman performance. However, we consider RL as fundamentally a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) paradigm, even when an agent eventually performs its task autonomously. In cases where the reward function is challenging or impossible to define, HITL approaches are considered particularly advantageous. The application of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in systems such as ChatGPT demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing for user experience and integrating their feedback into the training loop. In HITL RL, human input is integrated during the agent\u2019s learning process, allowing iterative updates and fine-tuning based on human feedback, thus enhancing the agent\u2019s performance. Since the human is an essential part of this process, we argue that human-centric approaches are the key to successful RL, a fact that has not been adequately considered in the existing literature. This paper aims to inform readers about current explainability methods in HITL RL. It also shows how the application of explainable AI (xAI) and specific improvements to existing explainability approaches can enable a better human-agent interaction in HITL RL for all types of users, whether for lay people, domain experts, or machine learning specialists. Accounting for the workflow in HITL RL and based on software and machine learning methodologies, this article identifies four phases for human involvement for creating HITL RL systems: (1) Agent Development, (2) Agent Learning, (3) Agent Evaluation, and (4) Agent Deployment. We highlight human involvement, explanation requirements, new challenges, and goals for each phase. We furthermore identify low-risk, high-return opportunities for explainability research in HITL RL and present long-term research goals to advance the field. Finally, we propose a vision of human-robot collaboration that allows both parties to reach their full potential and cooperate effectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We study the early adoption and diffusion of five artificial intelligence (AI)\u2010related technologies (automated\u2010guided vehicles, machine learning, machine vision, natural language processing, and voice recognition) as documented in the 2018 Annual Business Survey of 850,000 firms across the United States. We find that fewer than 6% of firms used any of the AI\u2010related technologies we measure, though most very large firms reported at least some AI use. Weighted by employment, average adoption was just over 18%. AI use in production, while varying considerably by industry, was found in every sector of the economy and clustered with emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and robotics. Among dynamic young firms, AI use was highest alongside more\u2010educated, more\u2010experienced, and younger owners, including owners motivated by bringing new ideas to market or helping the community. AI adoption was also more common in startups displaying indicators of high\u2010growth entrepreneurship, including venture capital funding, recent product and process innovation, and growth\u2010oriented business strategies. Early AI adoption was far from evenly distributed: a handful of \u201csuperstar\u201d cities and emerging hubs led startups' adoption of AI. These patterns of early AI use foreshadow economic and social impacts far beyond this limited initial diffusion, with the possibility of a growing \u201cAI divide\u201d if early patterns persist.",

        "abstract": "The digital transformation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) is a critical phenomenon shaping the global business landscape. This paper presents a comparative review between the United States and Africa, exploring the diverse trajectories of digitalization within these regions. While the USA is often at the forefront of technological advancements, Africa's SMEs exhibit unique challenges and opportunities in their digital transformation journey. In the United States, SMEs have embraced digital technologies to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experiences, and gain a competitive edge. The adoption of cloud computing, data analytics, and e-commerce platforms has become ubiquitous, fostering innovation and scalability. This comparative study delves into the specific strategies employed by American SMEs to navigate the complexities of the digital era. On the contrary, African SMEs face distinct hurdles in their digital transformation efforts. Infrastructure limitations, limited access to capital, and a diverse economic landscape present unique challenges. However, this review sheds light on the innovative approaches taken by African SMEs to overcome these barriers. Leveraging mobile technology, localized digital solutions, and collaborative networks, African SMEs are carving out their digital paths. Moreover, this comparative review emphasizes the role of government policies and support mechanisms in shaping the digital transformation landscape for SMEs in both regions.

        "abstract": "Food and nutrition are a steadfast essential to all living organisms. With specific reference to humans, the sufficient and efficient supply of food is a challenge as the world population continues to grow. Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be identified as a plausible technology in this 5th industrial revolution in bringing us closer to achieving zero hunger by 2030\u2014Goal 2 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). This goal cannot be achieved unless the digital divide among developed and underdeveloped countries is addressed. Nevertheless, developing and underdeveloped regions fall behind in economic resources; however, they harbor untapped potential to effectively address the impending demands posed by the soaring world population. Therefore, this study explores the in-depth potential of AI in the agriculture sector for developing and under-developed countries. Similarly, it aims to emphasize the proven efficiency and spin-off applications of AI in the advancement of agriculture. Currently, AI is being utilized in various spheres of agriculture, including but not limited to crop surveillance, irrigation management, disease identification, fertilization practices, task automation, image manipulation, data processing, yield forecasting, supply chain optimization, implementation of decision support system (DSS), weed control, and the enhancement of resource utilization. Whereas AI supports food safety and security by ensuring higher crop yields that are acquired by harnessing the potential of multi-temporal remote sensing (RS) techniques to accurately discern diverse crop phenotypes, monitor land cover dynamics, assess variations in soil organic matter, predict soil moisture levels, conduct plant biomass modeling, and enable comprehensive crop monitoring. The present study identifies various challenges, including financial, infrastructure, experts, data availability, customization, regulatory framework, cultural norms and attitudes, access to market, and interdisciplinary collaboration, in the adoption of AI for developing nations with their subsequent remedies. The identification of challenges and opportunities in the implementation of AI could ignite further research and actions in these regions; thereby supporting sustainable development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), algorithm optimization and high-throughput experiments has enabled scientists to accelerate the discovery of new chemicals and materials with unprecedented efficiency, resilience and precision. Over the recent years, the so-called autonomous experimentation (AE) systems are featured as key AI innovation to enhance and accelerate research and development (R&amp;D). Also known as self-driving laboratories or materials acceleration platforms, AE systems are digital platforms capable of running a large number of experiments autonomously. Those systems are rapidly impacting biomedical research and clinical innovation, in areas such as drug discovery, nanomedicine, precision oncology, and others. As it is expected that AE will impact healthcare innovation from local to global levels, its implications for science and technology in emerging economies should be examined. By examining the increasing relevance of AE in contemporary R&amp;D activities, this article aims to explore the advancement of artificial intelligence in biomedical research and health innovation, highlighting its implications, challenges and opportunities in emerging economies. AE presents an opportunity for stakeholders from emerging economies to co-produce the global knowledge landscape of AI in health. However, asymmetries in R&amp;D capabilities should be acknowledged since emerging economies suffers from inadequacies and discontinuities in resources and funding. The establishment of decentralized AE infrastructures could support stakeholders to overcome local restrictions and opens venues for more culturally diverse, equitable, and trustworthy development of AI in health-related R&amp;D through meaningful partnerships and engagement. Collaborations with innovators from emerging economies could facilitate anticipation of fiscal pressures in science and technology policies, obsolescence of knowledge infrastructures, ethical and regulatory policy lag, and other issues present in the Global South. Also, improving cultural and geographical representativeness of AE contributes to foster the diffusion and acceptance of AI in health-related R&amp;D worldwide. Institutional preparedness is critical and could enable stakeholders to navigate opportunities of AI in biomedical research and health innovation in the coming years.",

Its primary objective is to identify and send only defective modules to the testing stage. This research introduces an intelligent ensemble-based software defect prediction model that combines diverse classifiers. The proposed model employs a two-stage prediction process to detect defective modules. In the first stage, four supervised machine learning algorithms are employed: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Na&#x00EF;ve Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network. These algorithms are optimized through iterative parameter optimization to achieve the highest accuracy possible. In the second stage, the predictive accuracy of the individual classifiers is integrated into a voting ensemble to make the final predictions. This ensemble approach further improves the accuracy and reliability of the defect predictions. Seven historical defect datasets from the NASA MDP repository, namely CM1, JM1, MC2, MW1, PC1, PC3, and PC4, were utilized to implement and evaluate the proposed defect prediction system. The results demonstrate that each dataset&#x2019;s proposed intelligent system achieved remarkable accuracy, outperforming twenty state-of-the-art defect prediction techniques, including base classifiers and ensemble methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Our global landscape of emerging technologies is increasingly affected by artificial intelligence (AI) hype, a phenomenon with significant large-scale consequences for the global AI narratives being created today. This paper aims to dissect the phenomenon of AI hype in light of its core mechanisms, drawing comparisons between the current wave and historical episodes of AI hype, concluding that the current hype is historically unmatched in terms of magnitude, scale and planetary and social costs. We identify and discuss socio-technical mechanisms fueling AI hype, including anthropomorphism, the proliferation of self-proclaimed AI \u201cexperts\u201d, the geopolitical and private sector \u201cfear of missing out\u201d trends and the overuse and misappropriation of the term \u201cAI\u201d in emerging technologies. The second part of the paper seeks to highlight the often-overlooked costs of the current AI hype. We examine its planetary costs as the AI hype exerts tremendous pressure on finite resources and energy consumption. Additionally, we focus on the connection between AI hype and socio-economic injustices, including perpetuation of social inequalities by the huge associated redistribution of wealth and costs to human intelligence. In the conclusion, we offer insights into the implications for how to mitigate AI hype moving forward. We give recommendations of how developers, regulators, deployers and the public can navigate the relationship between AI hype, innovation, investment and scientific exploration, while addressing critical societal and environmental challenges.",

This review investigates the multidimensional role of AI in the pandemic, which arises as a global health crisis, and its role in preparedness and responses, ranging from enhanced epidemiological modelling to the acceleration of vaccine development. The confluence of AI technologies has guided us in a new era of data-driven decision-making, revolutionizing our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and treat infectious illnesses. The review begins by discussing the impact of a pandemic on emerging countries worldwide, elaborating on the critical significance of AI in epidemiological modelling, bringing data-driven decision-making, and enabling forecasting, mitigation and response to the pandemic. In epidemiology, AI-driven epidemiological models like SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) and SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) are applied to predict the spread of disease, preventing outbreaks and optimising vaccine distribution. The review also demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and predictive analytics improve our knowledge of disease propagation patterns. The collaborative aspect of AI in vaccine discovery and clinical trials of various vaccines is emphasised, focusing on constructing AI-powered surveillance networks. Conclusively, the review presents a comprehensive assessment of how AI impacts epidemiological modelling, builds AI-enabled dynamic models by collaborating ML and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, and develops and implements vaccines and clinical trials. The review also focuses on screening, forecasting, contact tracing and monitoring the virus-causing pandemic. It advocates for sustained research, real-world implications, ethical application and strategic integration of AI technologies to strengthen our collective ability to face and alleviate the effects of global health issues.",

This survey explores how AI-driven technologies improve tactical communication networks, radar-based data transmission, UAV-assisted relay systems, and electronic warfare resilience. The study highlights AI applications in adaptive signal processing, multi-agent coordination for network optimization, radar-assisted target tracking, and AI-driven electronic countermeasures. Our work introduces a novel three-criteria evaluation methodology. It systematically assesses AI applications based on general system objectives, communications constraints in the military domain, and critical tactical environmental factors. We analyze key AI techniques for different types of learning applied to multi-domain network interoperability and distributed data information fusion in military operations. We also address challenges such as adversarial AI threats, the real-time adaptability of autonomous communication networks, and the limitations of current AI models under battlefield conditions. Finally, we discuss emerging trends in self-healing networks, AI-augmented decision support systems, and intelligent spectrum allocation. We provide a structured roadmap for future AI-driven defense communications and networking research.",

        "abstract": "Computing is at the forefront of advances in human civilization and technology. Alongside communication, it is a critical technology that often drives improvements in many other scientific fields. Over the last 60 years, computing has achieved unprecedented advances attributed to scaling laws predicted by Moore\u2019s law, whereby the number of components on a chip doubles every two years, and Dennard\u2019s voltage scaling, whereby the voltage of components is also halved. However, continuous similar advances are no longer necessarily guaranteed, leading to the potential emergence of the so-called \u2018Beyond Moore\u2019s Law\u2019 era. Even while traditional transistor scaling is ending, the demand for computing continues to grow in all sectors of the economy by almost orders of magnitude. The end of traditional scaling is expected to result in a computing crunch due to an energy crisis, necessitating the exploration of renewable sources of energy and computers that consume far less energy. Among many possible alternative computing architectures, neuromorphic computing based on brain-inspired computing is one of the most promising (Feng et al., 2018; Himelstein, 2022; Schell, 2024).",

        "abstract": "With the advent of generative AI (genAI), the potential scope of artificial intelligence has increased dramatically, but the future effect of genAI on productivity remains uncertain. The effect of the technology on the innovation process is a crucial open question. Some inventions, such as the light bulb, temporarily raise productivity growth as adoption spreads, but the effect fades when the market is saturated; that is, the level of output per hour is permanently higher but the growth rate is not. In contrast, two types of technologies stand out as having longer-lived effects on productivity growth. First, there are technologies known as general-purpose technologies (GPTs). GPTs (1) are widely adopted, (2) spur abundant knock-on innovations (new goods and services, process efficiencies, and business reorganization), and (3) show continual improvement, refreshing this innovation cycle; the electric dynamo is an example. Second, there are inventions of methods of invention (IMIs). IMIs increase the efficiency of the research and development process via improvements to observation, analysis, communication, or organization; the compound microscope is an example. We show that GenAI has the characteristics of both a GPT and an IMI -- an encouraging sign that genAI will raise the \\textit{level} of productivity. Even so, genAI's contribution to productivity \\textit{growth} will depend on the speed with which that level is attained and, historically, integrating revolutionary technologies into the economy is a protracted process.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrated extraordinary capability in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including language translation, text generation, question answering, etc. Moreover, LLMs are new and essential part of computerized language processing, having the ability to understand complex verbal patterns and generate coherent and appropriate replies in a given context. Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a plethora of research on LLMs have been appeared within a short time, it is quite impossible to track all of these and get an overview of the current state of research in this area. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLMs training phase. Then the paper provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper also demonstrates the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. The study also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Finally, the paper also explores open issues and challenges to deploy LLMs in real-world scenario. Our review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals.",

        "title": "A Survey of Text Classification With Transformers: How Wide? How Large? How Long? How Accurate? How Expensive? How Safe?",
        "abstract": "Text classification in natural language processing (NLP) is evolving rapidly, particularly with the surge in transformer-based models, including large language models (LLM). This paper presents an in-depth survey of text classification techniques across diverse benchmarks, addressing applications from sentiment analysis to chatbot-driven question-answering. Methodologically, it utilizes NLP-facilitated approaches such as co-citation and bibliographic coupling alongside traditional research techniques. Because new use cases continue to emerge in this dynamic field, the study proposes an expanded taxonomy of text classification applications, extending the focus beyond unimodal (text-only) inputs to explore the emerging field of multimodal classification. While offering a comprehensive review of text classification with LLMs, this review highlights novel questions that arise when approaching the task with transformers: It evaluates the use of multimodal data, including text, numeric, and columnar data, and discusses the evolution of text input lengths (tokens) for long text classification; it covers the historical development of transformer-based models, emphasizing recent advancements in LLMs; it evaluates model accuracy on 358 datasets across 20 applications, with results challenging the assumption that LLMs are universally superior, revealing unexpected findings related to accuracy, cost, and safety; and it explores issues related to cost and access as models become increasingly expensive. Finally, the survey discusses new social and ethical implications raised when using LLMs for text classification, including bias and copyright. Throughout, the review emphasizes the importance of a nuanced understanding of model performance and a holistic approach to deploying transformer-based models in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) has become a hot research topic. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been widely used in a wide range of real-world application areas due to the in-depth spectral information stored within each pixel. Noticeably, the detailed features, i.e., a nonlinear correlation between the obtained spectral data and the correlating HSI data object, generate efficient classification results that are complex for traditional techniques. Deep learning (DL) has recently been validated as an influential feature extractor that efficiently identifies the nonlinear issues that have arisen in various computer vision challenges. This motivates using DL for HSIC, which shows promising results. This survey provides a brief description of DL for HSIC and compares cutting-edge methodologies in the field. We will first summarize the key challenges for HSIC, and then, we will discuss the superiority of DL and DL ensemble in addressing these issues. In this article, we divide state-of-the-art DL methodologies and DL with ensemble into spectral features, spatial features, and combined spatial&#x2013;spectral features in order to comprehensively and critically evaluate the progress (future research directions as well) of such methodologies for HSIC. Furthermore, we will take into account that DL involves a substantial percentage of labeled training images, whereas obtaining such a number for HSI is time and cost consuming. As a result, this survey describes some methodologies for improving the classification performance of DL techniques, which can serve as future recommendations.",

The methods allow maintainers of systems and hardware to reduce financial and time costs of upkeep. As these methods are adopted for more serious and potentially life-threatening applications, the human operators need trust the predictive system. This attracts the field of Explainable AI (XAI) to introduce explainability and interpretability into the predictive system. XAI brings methods to the field of predictive maintenance that can amplify trust in the users while maintaining well-performing systems. This survey on explainable predictive maintenance (XPM) discusses and presents the current methods of XAI as applied to predictive maintenance while following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. We categorize the different XPM methods into groups that follow the XAI literature. Additionally, we include current challenges and a discussion on future research directions in XPM.",

        "abstract": "This report provides an evidence-based review of current strategies to manage dry eye disease (DED). First-line management focuses on methods to replenish, conserve, and stimulate the tear film, with an emphasis on ocular supplements, which remain the cornerstone of DED treatment. Meibomian gland dysfunction, a primary contributor to DED, is typically treated with warm compresses and a wide variety of in-office treatments, including device-driven technologies to warm the eyelids, intense pulsed light therapy, low-level light therapy, and other new and emerging technologies. Lid hygiene treatments include lid wipes, anti-Demodex therapies, blepharoexfoliation, and topical antibiotics. DED caused by certain etiological drivers can benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies, including topical and oral corticosteroids, T-cell immunomodulatory drugs, and a wide variety of pharmacological agents, in addition to biologic tear substitutes such as autologous serum and platelet-rich plasma. Emerging therapies, such as neuromodulation via nasal neurostimulation and novel pharmacological treatments, offer potential future options. Advanced options, including amniotic membrane grafts and complex surgical methods, provide options for severe or refractory cases. Lifestyle modifications, including optimized blinking, dietary supplementation, and environmental adjustments, play a crucial role in long-term management. Patient education and adherence to treatment regimens remain essential for sustained symptom relief. The TFOS DEWS III prescribing algorithm provides an evidence-based framework to offer guidance to clinicians in selecting relevant interventions based on disease etiology that aim to provide targeted management of the relevant DED subtype(s) that an individual is experiencing.",

        "title": "A Comprehensive Review of Direction-of-Arrival Estimation and Localization Approaches in Mixed-Field Sources Scenario",
        "abstract": "Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation plays a crucial role in array signal processing across various domains, including radar, sonar, wireless communications, and seismic exploration. However, traditional DOA techniques often assume either far-field (FF) or near-field (NF) propagation, limiting their applicability in scenarios involving mixed-field sources. DOA estimation and localization in scenarios involving mixed NF and FF sources is a complex and dynamic field that has garnered significant research attention in recent years. This multifaceted and evolving area holds promise for addressing challenges in radar, wireless communications, and acoustic sensing applications. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, techniques, and advancements in this domain. We categorize existing methodologies, discussing their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we delve into the mathematical modeling of mixed-field sources and essential signal processing techniques for parameter estimation. Special attention is given to technical issues such as aperture loss, computational complexity, and hardware considerations. The paper discusses the various sources of noise in the mentioned scenario and highlights the importance of modeling noise accurately for effective estimation. It also explores different scenarios and assumptions considered in the literature, ranging from non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise environments to scenarios involving multipath propagation and unknown mutual coupling effects. A detailed examination of the statistical approaches used in DOA estimation and localization reveals a diverse range of methods, including higher-order statistics and second-order statistics, each with its own advantages and applications. A comparative evaluation of various approaches highlights their performance in terms of estimation accuracy, resolution, aperture loss and computational efficiency. This provides insights into the trade-offs involved in choosing between different approaches. The review also identifies promising future research directions, such as the exploration of advanced signal processing techniques like compressive sensing and deep learning, exact NF modeling, estimation based on one-bit measurements, the integration of polarization diversity, employing metasurface antennas, tracking parameters, and the utilization of full-wave or experimental data for a more realistic representation of the challenges. By reviewing advances in methodologies and techniques, as well as outlining future research directions aimed at addressing the complexities of mixed-field scenarios, this paper paves the way for the development of more robust and reliable localization systems capable of handling real-world complexities.",

        "abstract": "In the current era of energy conservation and emission reduction, the development of electric and other new energy vehicles is booming. With their various attributes, lithium batteries have become the ideal power source for new energy vehicles. However, lithium-ion batteries are highly sensitive to temperature changes. Excessive temperatures, either high or low, can lead to abnormal operation of the batteries, posing a threat to the safety of the entire vehicle. Therefore, developing a reliable and efficient Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) that can monitor battery status and prevent thermal runaway is becoming increasingly important. In recent years, deep learning has gradually become widely applied in various fields as an efficient method, and it has also been applied to some extent in the development of BTMS. In this work, we discuss the basic principles of deep learning and related optimization principles and elaborate on the algorithmic principles, frameworks, and applications of various advanced deep learning methods in BTMS. We also discuss several emerging deep learning algorithms proposed in recent years, their principles, and their feasibility in BTMS applications. Finally, we discuss the obstacles faced by various deep learning algorithms in the development of BTMS and potential directions for development, proposing some ideas for progress. This paper aims to analyze the advanced deep learning technologies commonly used in BTMS and some emerging deep learning technologies and provide new insights into the current combination of deep learning technology in new energy trams to assist the development of BTMS.",

Although the inborn connection with frequency domain, existing pan-sharpening research has not almost investigated the potential solution upon frequency domain. To this end, we propose a novel Frequency Adaptive Mixture of Experts (FAME) learning framework for pan-sharpening, which consists of three key components: the Adaptive Frequency Separation Prediction Module, the Sub-Frequency Learning Expert Module, and the Expert Mixture Module. In detail, the first leverages the discrete cosine transform to perform frequency separation by predicting the frequency mask. On the basis of generated mask, the second with low-frequency MOE and high-frequency MOE takes account for enabling the effective low-frequency and high-frequency information reconstruction. Followed by, the final fusion module dynamically weights high frequency and low-frequency MOE knowledge to adapt to remote sensing images with significant content variations. Quantitative and qualitative experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our method performs the best against other state-of-the-art ones and comprises a strong generalization ability for real-world scenes.

        "abstract": "Abstract Engineering of catalytically active inorganic nanomaterials holds promising prospects for biomedicine. Catalytically active metal oxides show applications in enhancing wound healing but have also been employed to induce cell death in photodynamic or radiation therapy. Upon introduction into a biological system, nanomaterials are exposed to complex fluids, causing interaction and adsorption of ions and proteins. While protein corona formation on nanomaterials is acknowledged, its modulation of nanomaterial catalytic efficacy is less understood. In this study, proteomic analyses and nano\u2010analytic methodologies quantify and characterize adsorbed proteins, correlating this protein layer with metal oxide catalytic activity in vitro and in vivo. The protein corona comprises up to 280 different proteins, constituting up to 38% by weight. Enhanced complement factors and other opsonins on nanocatalyst surfaces lead to their uptake into macrophages when applied topically, localizing &gt;99% of the nanomaterials in tissue\u2010resident macrophages. Initially, the formation of the protein corona significantly reduces the nanocatalysts' activity, but this activity can be partially recovered in endosomal conditions due to the proteolytic degradation of the corona. Overall, the research reveals the complex relationship between physisorbed proteins and the catalytic characteristics of specific metal oxide nanoparticles, providing design parameters for optimizing nanocatalysts in complex biological environments.",

By reading the content, both industry professionals and academic researchers can gain a comprehensive knowledge of improvements from the integration of AI and remote sensing, understanding the trend of Gas flares monitoring. The paper commences with an analysis of RGB camera-based methods, focusing on how their combination with cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning algorithms can significantly improve the detection, segmentation, and measurement of gas flare systems. It then explores the use of hyper-spectral imaging techniques, including infrared cameras and space-borne satellite sensors, underscoring their potential in remote monitoring and performance analysis. Additionally, the effectiveness of multi-view inspection methods is assessed, highlighting how these approaches enhance the monitoring capabilities. Finally, the paper identifies key research areas that require further attention. It also presents a clearer direction for future progress, emphasizing the importance of continuous research to foster advancements and facilitate broader commercial adoption.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Reward-Based Crowdfunding offers an opportunity for innovative ventures that would not be supported through traditional financing. A key problem for those seeking funding is understanding which features of a crowdfunding campaign will sway the decisions of a sufficient number of funders. Predictive models of fund-raising campaigns used in combination with Explainable AI methods promise to provide such insights. However, previous work on Explainable AI has largely focused on quantitative structured data. In this study, our aim is to construct explainable models of human decisions based on analysis of natural language text, thus contributing to a fast-growing body of research on the use of Explainable AI for text analytics. We propose a novel method to construct predictions based on text via semantic clustering of sentences, which, compared with traditional methods using individual words and phrases, allows complex meaning contained in the text to be operationalised. Using experimental evaluation, we compare our proposed method to keyword extraction and topic modelling, which have traditionally been used in similar applications. Our results demonstrate that the sentence clustering method produces features with significant predictive power, compared to keyword-based methods and topic models, but which are much easier to interpret for human raters. We furthermore conduct a SHAP analysis of the models incorporating sentence clusters, demonstrating concrete insights into the types of natural language content that influence the outcome of crowdfunding campaigns.",

        "abstract": "Predicting chemical reaction yields is pivotal for efficient chemical synthesis, an area that focuses on the creation of novel compounds for diverse uses. Yield prediction demands accurate representations of reactions for forecasting practical transformation rates. Yet, the uncertainty issues broadcasting in real-world situations prohibit current models to excel in this task owing to the high sensitivity of yield activities and the uncertainty in yield measurements. Existing models often utilize single-modal feature representations, such as molecular fingerprints, SMILES sequences, or molecular graphs, which is not sufficient to capture the complex interactions and dynamic behavior of molecules in reactions. In this paper, we present an advanced Uncertainty-Aware Multimodal model (UAM) to tackle these challenges. Our approach seamlessly integrates data sources from multiple modalities by encompassing sequence representations, molecular graphs, and expert-defined chemical reaction features for a comprehensive representation of reactions. Additionally, we address both the model and data-based uncertainty, refining the model's predictive capability. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including two high throughput experiment (HTE) datasets and one chemist-constructed Amide coupling reaction dataset, demonstrate that UAM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

The PLSA, originally a tool for information retrieval, provides a probabilistic sense for a table of co-occurrences as a mixture of multinomial distributions spanned over a latent class variable and adjusted with the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm. The distributional assumptions and the iterative nature lead to a rigid model, dividing enthusiasts and detractors. Those drawbacks have led to several reformulations: the extension of the method to normal data distributions and a non-parametric formulation obtained with the help of Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques. Furthermore, the combination of theoretical studies and programming techniques alleviates the computational problem, thus making the potential of the method explicit: its relation with the Singular value decomposition (SVD), which means that PLSA can be used to satisfactorily support other techniques, such as the construction of Fisher kernels, the probabilistic interpretation of Principal component analysis (PCA), Transfer learning (TL), and the training of neural networks, among others. We also present open questions as a practical and theoretical research window.",

However, the trace concentrations of these markers in complex physiological environments pose significant challenges to efficient detection. It is necessary to avoid interference from non-specific signals, which may lead to misjudgment of other substances as biomarkers and affect the accuracy of detection results. With the rapid advancements in electrochemical technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, intelligent electrochemical biosensors have emerged as a promising approach for biomedical detection, offering speed, specificity, high sensitivity, and accuracy. This review focuses on elaborating the latest applications of AI-empowered electrochemical biosensors in the biomedical field, including disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, drug development, and wearable devices. AI algorithms can further improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and repeatability of electrochemical sensors through the screening and performance prediction of sensor materials, as well as the feature extraction and noise reduction suppression of sensing signals. Even in complex physiological microenvironments, they can effectively address common issues such as electrode fouling, poor signal-to-noise ratio, chemical interference, and matrix effects.

These inspection techniques take too much time and affect patients\u2019 compliance and cooperation, while difficult for clinicians to comprehend the principle of detection decisions. This study proposes a novel method using face diagnosis images based on traditional Chinese medicine principles, providing a non-invasive, efficient, and interpretable alternative for SZ detection. Methods: An innovative face diagnosis image analysis method for SZ detection, which learns feature representations based on Vision Transformer (ViT) directly from face diagnosis images. It provides a face features distribution visualization and quantitative importance of each facial region and is proposed to supplement interpretation and to increase efficiency in SZ detection while keeping a high detection accuracy. Results: A benchmarking platform comprising 921 face diagnostic images, 6 benchmark methods, and 4 evaluation metrics was established. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves SZ detection performance with a 3\u201310% increase in accuracy scores. Additionally, it is found that facial regions rank in descending order according to importance in SZ detection as eyes, mouth, forehead, cheeks, and nose, which is exactly consistent with the clinical traditional Chinese medicine experience. Conclusions: Our method fully leverages semantic feature representations of first-introduced face diagnosis images in SZ, offering strong interpretability and visualization capabilities. It not only opens a new path for SZ detection but also brings new tools and concepts to the research and application in the field of mental illness.",

        "abstract": "Block bootstrap is widely used in constructing confidence intervals for parameters estimated from stationary time series.Theoretically, the method should provide valid confidence intervals as the length of the time series goes to infinity.In practice, however, it is necessary to know how large of a finite sample is required for block bootstrap confidence intervals to work well.This study aims to answer this question in a simple simulation setting where the data are generated from a first-order autoregressive process.The empirical coverage rates of several commonly used bootstrap confidence intervals for the mean, standard deviation, and the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient are compared.A quite large sample is found necessary for the intervals to have the right coverage rates even when estimating a simple parameter like the mean.Some block bootstrap methods could fail when estimating the lag-1 autocorrelation.It is surprising that the coverage property even deteriorates as the sample size increases with some commonly used block bootstrap confidence intervals including the percentile intervals and bias-corrected intervals.",

        "title": "A machine learning ride in the physics theme park: from quantum to biophysics",
        "abstract": "(English) The integration of artificial intelligence into research is propelling progress and discoveries across the entire scientific landscape. Artificial intelligence tools boost the development of novel scientific insights and theories by processing extensive data sets, guiding exploration and hypothesis formation, enhancing experimental setups, and even enabling autonomous discovery. In this thesis, we harness the power of machine learning, a sub-field of artificial intelligence, to study non-deterministic systems, which are amongst the hardest to characterize. On one hand, we address problems inherent to the study of quantum systems and the development of quantum technologies. Quantum physics presents formidable challenges due to the associated exponential complexity with the size of the system at hand, as well as its intrinsic stochastic nature and the presence of intricate correlations between its components. We employ reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique that excels at dealing with vast hypothesis spaces, to address some of these challenges. Notably, reinforcement learning has demonstrated super-human performance in multiple complex games like Go, which present similar characteristics to the problems encountered in the study of quantum physics. We use it to systematically simplify complex common problems in condensed matter and quantum information processing tasks, as well as to implement robust calibration schemes for quantum computers. On the other hand, we focus on the characterization of complex stochastic processes, such as diffusion. Understanding diffusion processes is crucial to unravel the complex underlying physical and biological mechanisms governing them. This involves extracting meaningful parameters from the analysis of stochastic trajectories described by tracked particles. However, accurately capturing and analyzing the trajectories presents multiple challenges, stemming from the combination of their random nature, complex dynamics, and experimental drawbacks, such as noise. We develop machine learning algorithms to accurately extract such parameters, even when they vary with time, and demonstrate their applicability in experimental scenarios. Furthermore, we apply similar techniques to study the diffusion of internet users browsing an e-commerce website, predicting their likelihood to make a purchase before closing the session.

        "abstract": "Abstract Autonomous agents have long been a research focus in academic and industry communities. Previous research often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from human learning processes, and makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of Web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in human-level intelligence, leading to a surge in research on LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. We first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents, proposing a unified framework that encompasses much of previous work. Then, we present a overview of the diverse applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in social science, natural science, and engineering. Finally, we delve into the evaluation strategies commonly used for LLM-based autonomous agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In computer vision, a series of exemplary advances have been made in several areas involving image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and image super-resolution reconstruction with the rapid development of deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN has superior features for autonomous learning and expression, and feature extraction from original input data can be realized by means of training CNN models that match practical applications. Due to the rapid progress in deep learning technology, the structure of CNN is becoming more and more complex and diverse. Consequently, it gradually replaces the traditional machine learning methods. This paper presents an elementary understanding of CNN components and their functions, including input layers, convolution layers, pooling layers, activation functions, batch normalization, dropout, fully connected layers, and output layers. On this basis, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of the past and current research status of the applications of CNN models in computer vision fields, e.g., image classification, object detection, and video prediction. In addition, we summarize the challenges and solutions of the deep CNN, and future research directions are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrated extraordinary capability in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including language translation, text generation, question answering, etc. Moreover, LLMs are new and essential part of computerized language processing, having the ability to understand complex verbal patterns and generate coherent and appropriate replies in a given context. Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a plethora of research on LLMs have been appeared within a short time, it is quite impossible to track all of these and get an overview of the current state of research in this area. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLMs training phase. Then the paper provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper also demonstrates the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. The study also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Finally, the paper also explores open issues and challenges to deploy LLMs in real-world scenario. Our review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals.",

        "abstract": "The landscape of medical treatments is undergoing a transformative shift. Precision medicine has ushered in a revolutionary era in healthcare by individualizing diagnostics and treatments according to each patient\u2019s uniquely evolving health status. This groundbreaking method of tailoring disease prevention and treatment considers individual variations in genes, environments, and lifestyles. The goal of precision medicine is to target the \u201cfive rights\u201d: the right patient, the right drug, the right time, the right dose, and the right route. In this pursuit, in silico techniques have emerged as an anchor, driving precision medicine forward and making this a realistic and promising avenue for personalized therapies. With the advancements in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data, including genetic variants and their interactions with each other and the environment, can be incorporated into clinical decision-making. Pharmacometrics, gathering pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, and mathematical models further contribute to drug optimization, drug behavior prediction, and drug\u2013drug interaction identification. Digital health, wearables, and computational tools offer continuous monitoring and real-time data collection, enabling treatment adjustments. Furthermore, the incorporation of extensive datasets in computational tools, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and omics data, is also another pathway to acquire meaningful information in this field. Although they are fairly new, machine learning (ML) algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are also resources researchers use to analyze big data and develop predictive models. This review explores the interplay of these multiple in silico approaches in advancing precision medicine and fostering individual healthcare.

        "abstract": "Abstract The advent of large language models marks a revolutionary breakthrough in artificial intelligence. With the unprecedented scale of training and model parameters, the capability of large language models has been dramatically improved, leading to human-like performances in understanding, language synthesizing, common-sense reasoning, etc. Such a major leap forward in general AI capacity will fundamentally change the pattern of how personalization is conducted. For one thing, it will reform the way of interaction between humans and personalization systems. Instead of being a passive medium of information filtering, like conventional recommender systems and search engines, large language models present the foundation for active user engagement. On top of such a new foundation, users\u2019 requests can be proactively explored, and users\u2019 required information can be delivered in a natural, interactable, and explainable way. For another thing, it will also considerably expand the scope of personalization, making it grow from the sole function of collecting personalized information to the compound function of providing personalized services. By leveraging large language models as a general-purpose interface, the personalization systems may compile user\u2019s requests into plans, calls the functions of external tools (e.g., search engines, calculators, service APIs, etc.) to execute the plans, and integrate the tools\u2019 outputs to complete the end-to-end personalization tasks. Today, large language models are still being rapidly developed, whereas the application in personalization is largely unexplored. Therefore, we consider it to be right the time to review the challenges in personalization and the opportunities to address them with large language models. In particular, we dedicate this perspective paper to the discussion of the following aspects: the development and challenges for the existing personalization system, the newly emerged capabilities of large language models, and the potential ways of making use of large language models for personalization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, machine learning (ML) has attained a high level of achievement in many contexts. Considering the significance of ML in medical and bioinformatics owing to its accuracy, many investigators discussed multiple solutions for developing the function of medical and bioinformatics challenges using deep learning (DL) techniques. The importance of DL in Internet of Things (IoT)-based bio- and medical informatics lies in its ability to analyze and interpret large amounts of complex and diverse data in real time, providing insights that can improve healthcare outcomes and increase efficiency in the healthcare industry. Several applications of DL in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics include diagnosis, treatment recommendation, clinical decision support, image analysis, wearable monitoring, and drug discovery. The review aims to comprehensively evaluate and synthesize the existing body of the literature on applying deep learning in the intersection of the IoT with bio- and medical informatics. In this paper, we categorized the most cutting-edge DL solutions for medical and bioinformatics issues into five categories based on the DL technique utilized: convolutional neural network , recurrent neural network , generative adversarial network , multilayer perception , and hybrid methods. A systematic literature review was applied to study each one in terms of effective properties, like the main idea, benefits, drawbacks, methods, simulation environment, and datasets. After that, cutting-edge research on DL approaches and applications for bioinformatics concerns was emphasized. In addition, several challenges that contributed to DL implementation for medical and bioinformatics have been addressed, which are predicted to motivate more studies to develop medical and bioinformatics research progressively. According to the findings, most articles are evaluated using features like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F -score, latency, adaptability, and scalability.",

        "abstract": "Since Facebook was renamed Meta, a lot of attention, debate, and exploration have intensified about what the Metaverse is, how it works, and the possible ways to exploit it. It is anticipated that Metaverse will be a continuum of rapidly emerging technologies, usecases, capabilities, and experiences that will make it up for the next evolution of the Internet. Several researchers have already surveyed the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications in realizing the Metaverse. However, due to the rapid emergence and continuous evolution of technologies, there is a need for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of the role of AI, 6G, and the nexus of both in realizing the immersive experiences of Metaverse. Therefore, in this survey, we first introduce the background and ongoing progress in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR) and spatial computing, followed by the technical aspects of AI and 6G. Then, we survey the role of AI in the Metaverse by reviewing the state-of-the-art in deep learning, computer vision, and Edge AI to extract the requirements of 6G in Metaverse. Next, we investigate the promising services of B5G/6G towards Metaverse, followed by identifying the role of AI in 6G networks and 6G networks for AI in support of Metaverse applications, and the need for sustainability in Metaverse. Finally, we enlist the existing and potential applications, usecases, and projects to highlight the importance of progress in the Metaverse. Moreover, in order to provide potential research directions to researchers, we underline the challenges, research gaps, and lessons learned identified from the literature review of the aforementioned technologies.",

        "abstract": "Communication in millimeter wave (mmWave) and even terahertz (THz) frequency bands is ushering in a new era of wireless communications. Beam management, namely initial access and beam tracking, has been recognized as an essential technique to ensure robust mmWave/THz communications, especially for mobile scenarios. However, narrow beams at higher carrier frequency lead to huge beam measurement overhead, which has a negative impact on beam acquisition and tracking. In addition, the beam management process is further complicated by the fluctuation of mmWave/THz channels, the random movement patterns of users, and the dynamic changes in the environment. For mmWave and THz communications toward 6G, we have witnessed a substantial increase in research and industrial attention on artificial intelligence (AI), reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). The introduction of these enabling technologies presents both open opportunities and unique challenges for beam management. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on mmWave and THz beam management. Further, we give some insights on technical challenges and future research directions in this promising area.",

Building on existing research on Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Assistive Technologies and customized tools made by programmers, we shed light on the currently unexplored intersection of how DIY tools built and used by BLVSPs support accessible software development. Through semi-structured interviews with 30 BLVSPs, we found that such tools serve many different purposes and are driven by motivations such as desiring to maintain a professional image and a sense of dignity at work. These tools had significant impacts on workplace accessibility and revealed a need for a more centralized community for sharing tools, tips, and tricks. Based on our findings, we introduce the \"Double Hacker Dilemma\" and highlight a need for developing more effective peer and organizational platforms that support DIY tool sharing.",

A cognitive gap exists between established, human-centric problem-solving frameworks and the ad-hoc, unstructured methods currently used to prompt these AI systems. This paper introduces and formalizes Aiming Thinking (AT), a metacognitive framework designed to bridge this gap. We propose a three-level hierarchy of cognition to position AT as a Level 3 metathinking that structures human-AI collaboration. The framework is operationalized through four distinct pillars\u2014Targeting, Trajectory Design, Sequencing, and Calibration\u2014and a practical library of 20 actionable interaction patterns. We demonstrate the universality and utility of the framework by systematically mapping nine established thinking frameworks (e.g., Computational Thinking, Design Thinking, Critical Thinking) to the principles and patterns of AT. The result is a formal, teachable methodology that moves beyond intuitive prompting to enable more deliberate, reliable, and sophisticated human-AI co-creation.",

Although some noteworthy advancements have been made in this area, a comprehensive exploration of the intricate relationship between AIGC and communication networks remains relatively limited. To address this issue, this paper conducts an exhaustive survey from dual standpoints: firstly, it scrutinizes the integration of LLMs and AIGC technologies within the domain of communication networks; secondly, it investigates how the communication networks can further bolster the capabilities of LLMs and AIGC. Additionally, this research explores the promising applications along with the challenges encountered during the incorporation of these AI technologies into communication networks. Through these detailed analyses, our work aims to deepen the understanding of how LLMs and AIGC can synergize with and enhance the development of advanced intelligent communication networks, contributing to a more profound comprehension of next-generation intelligent communication networks.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrated extraordinary capability in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including language translation, text generation, question answering, etc. Moreover, LLMs are new and essential part of computerized language processing, having the ability to understand complex verbal patterns and generate coherent and appropriate replies in a given context. Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a plethora of research on LLMs have been appeared within a short time, it is quite impossible to track all of these and get an overview of the current state of research in this area. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLMs training phase. Then the paper provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper also demonstrates the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. The study also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Finally, the paper also explores open issues and challenges to deploy LLMs in real-world scenario. Our review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals.",

We outline a strategy that combines design principles for prompt engineering and the creation of a high-level function library which allows ChatGPT to adapt to different robotics tasks, simulators, and form factors. We focus our evaluations on the effectiveness of different prompt engineering techniques and dialog strategies towards the execution of various types of robotics tasks. We explore ChatGPT&#x2019;s ability to use free-form dialog, parse XML tags, and to synthesize code, in addition to the use of task-specific prompting functions and closed-loop reasoning through dialogues. Our study encompasses a range of tasks within the robotics domain, from basic logical, geometrical, and mathematical reasoning all the way to complex domains such as aerial navigation, manipulation, and embodied agents. We show that ChatGPT can be effective at solving several of such tasks, while allowing users to interact with it primarily via natural language instructions.

        "abstract": "Abstract Notably, real problems are increasingly complex and require sophisticated models and algorithms capable of quickly dealing with large data sets and finding optimal solutions. However, there is no perfect method or algorithm; all of them have some limitations that can be mitigated or eliminated by combining the skills of different methodologies. In this way, it is expected to develop hybrid algorithms that can take advantage of the potential and particularities of each method (optimization and machine learning) to integrate methodologies and make them more efficient. This paper presents an extensive systematic and bibliometric literature review on hybrid methods involving optimization and machine learning techniques for clustering and classification. It aims to identify the potential of methods and algorithms to overcome the difficulties of one or both methodologies when combined. After the description of optimization and machine learning methods, a numerical overview of the works published since 1970 is presented. Moreover, an in-depth state-of-art review over the last three years is presented. Furthermore, a SWOT analysis of the ten most cited algorithms of the collected database is performed, investigating the strengths and weaknesses of the pure algorithms and detaching the opportunities and threats that have been explored with hybrid methods. Thus, with this investigation, it was possible to highlight the most notable works and discoveries involving hybrid methods in terms of clustering and classification and also point out the difficulties of the pure methods and algorithms that can be strengthened through the inspirations of other methodologies; they are hybrid methods.",

        "abstract": "Given the large volume of remote sensing images collected daily, automatic object detection and segmentation have been a consistent need in Earth observation (EO). However, objects of interest vary in shape, size, appearance, and reflecting properties. This is not only reflected by the fact that these objects exhibit differences due to their geographical diversity but also by the fact that these objects appear differently in images collected from different sensors (optical and radar) and platforms (satellite, aerial, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)). Although there exists a plethora of object detection methods in the area of remote sensing, given the very fast development of prevalent deep learning methods, there is still a lack of recent updates for object detection methods. In this paper, we aim to provide an update that informs researchers about the recent development of object detection methods and their close sibling in the deep learning era, instance segmentation. The integration of these methods will cover approaches to data at different scales and modalities, such as optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and digital surface models (DSM). Specific emphasis will be placed on approaches addressing data and label limitations in this deep learning era. Further, we survey examples of remote sensing applications that benefited from automatic object detection and discuss future trends of the automatic object detection in EO.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computers offer an intriguing path for a paradigmatic change of computing in the natural sciences and beyond, with the potential for achieving a so-called quantum advantage\u2014namely, a significant (in some cases exponential) speedup of numerical simulations. The rapid development of hardware devices with various realizations of qubits enables the execution of small-scale but representative applications on quantum computers. In particular, the high-energy physics community plays a pivotal role in accessing the power of quantum computing, since the field is a driving source for challenging computational problems. This concerns, on the theoretical side, the exploration of models that are very hard or even impossible to address with classical techniques and, on the experimental side, the enormous data challenge of newly emerging experiments, such as the upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. In this Roadmap paper, led by CERN, DESY, and IBM, we provide the status of high-energy physics quantum computations and give examples of theoretical and experimental target benchmark applications, which can be addressed in the near future. Having in mind hardware with about 100 qubits capable of executing several thousand two-qubit gates, where possible, we also provide resource estimates for the examples given using error-mitigated quantum computing. The ultimate declared goal of this task force is therefore to trigger further research in the high-energy physics community to develop interesting use cases for demonstrations on near-term quantum computers.

        "title": "The deep learning applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics: a systematic literature review",
        "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, machine learning (ML) has attained a high level of achievement in many contexts. Considering the significance of ML in medical and bioinformatics owing to its accuracy, many investigators discussed multiple solutions for developing the function of medical and bioinformatics challenges using deep learning (DL) techniques. The importance of DL in Internet of Things (IoT)-based bio- and medical informatics lies in its ability to analyze and interpret large amounts of complex and diverse data in real time, providing insights that can improve healthcare outcomes and increase efficiency in the healthcare industry. Several applications of DL in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics include diagnosis, treatment recommendation, clinical decision support, image analysis, wearable monitoring, and drug discovery. The review aims to comprehensively evaluate and synthesize the existing body of the literature on applying deep learning in the intersection of the IoT with bio- and medical informatics. In this paper, we categorized the most cutting-edge DL solutions for medical and bioinformatics issues into five categories based on the DL technique utilized: convolutional neural network , recurrent neural network , generative adversarial network , multilayer perception , and hybrid methods. A systematic literature review was applied to study each one in terms of effective properties, like the main idea, benefits, drawbacks, methods, simulation environment, and datasets. After that, cutting-edge research on DL approaches and applications for bioinformatics concerns was emphasized. In addition, several challenges that contributed to DL implementation for medical and bioinformatics have been addressed, which are predicted to motivate more studies to develop medical and bioinformatics research progressively. According to the findings, most articles are evaluated using features like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F -score, latency, adaptability, and scalability.",

It leverages the power of quantum bits (qubits) and harnesses the unique properties exhibited by subatomic particles, such as superposition, entanglement, and interference. These quantum phenomena enable quantum computers to operate on an entirely different level, exponentially surpassing the computational capabilities of classical computers. By manipulating qubits and capitalising on their quantum states, QC holds the promise of solving complex problems that are currently intractable in the case of traditional computers. The potential impact of QC extends beyond its computational power and reaches into various critical sectors, including healthcare. Scientists and engineers are working diligently to overcome various challenges and limitations associated with QC technology. These include issues related to qubit stability, error correction, scalability, and noise reduction. In such a scenario, our proposed work provides a concise summary of the most recent state of the art based on articles published between 2018 and 2023 in the healthcare domain. Additionally, the approach follows the necessary guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review.

        "abstract": "There are two main ways to discover or design small drug molecules. The first involves fine-tuning existing molecules or commercially successful drugs through quantitative structure-activity relationships and virtual screening. The second approach involves generating new molecules through de novo drug design or inverse quantitative structure-activity relationship. Both methods aim to get a drug molecule with the best pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. However, bringing a new drug to market is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor, with the average cost being estimated at around $2.5 billion. One of the biggest challenges is screening the vast number of potential drug candidates to find one that is both safe and effective. The development of artificial intelligence in recent years has been phenomenal, ushering in a revolution in many fields. The field of pharmaceutical sciences has also significantly benefited from multiple applications of artificial intelligence, especially drug discovery projects. Artificial intelligence models are finding use in molecular property prediction, molecule generation, virtual screening, synthesis planning, repurposing, among others. Lately, generative artificial intelligence has gained popularity across domains for its ability to generate entirely new data, such as images, sentences, audios, videos, novel chemical molecules, etc. Generative artificial intelligence has also delivered promising results in drug discovery and development. This review article delves into the fundamentals and framework of various generative artificial intelligence models in the context of drug discovery via de novo drug design approach. Various basic and advanced models have been discussed, along with their recent applications.

        "abstract": "Text classification in natural language processing (NLP) is evolving rapidly, particularly with the surge in transformer-based models, including large language models (LLM). This paper presents an in-depth survey of text classification techniques across diverse benchmarks, addressing applications from sentiment analysis to chatbot-driven question-answering. Methodologically, it utilizes NLP-facilitated approaches such as co-citation and bibliographic coupling alongside traditional research techniques. Because new use cases continue to emerge in this dynamic field, the study proposes an expanded taxonomy of text classification applications, extending the focus beyond unimodal (text-only) inputs to explore the emerging field of multimodal classification. While offering a comprehensive review of text classification with LLMs, this review highlights novel questions that arise when approaching the task with transformers: It evaluates the use of multimodal data, including text, numeric, and columnar data, and discusses the evolution of text input lengths (tokens) for long text classification; it covers the historical development of transformer-based models, emphasizing recent advancements in LLMs; it evaluates model accuracy on 358 datasets across 20 applications, with results challenging the assumption that LLMs are universally superior, revealing unexpected findings related to accuracy, cost, and safety; and it explores issues related to cost and access as models become increasingly expensive. Finally, the survey discusses new social and ethical implications raised when using LLMs for text classification, including bias and copyright. Throughout, the review emphasizes the importance of a nuanced understanding of model performance and a holistic approach to deploying transformer-based models in real-world applications.",

This paradigm offers a promising solution to multiple challenges, including reducing oil consumption, lowering Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, enhancing air quality, improving the efficiency of the transportation sector, and facilitating the integration of renewable energy resources into the electric grid. Despite its potential, the electrification of vehicles encounters a major bottleneck-the need for diverse charging infrastructure options. Three groundbreaking technologies, including Dynamic Wireless Charging (DWC), Battery Swapping Stations, and Fast Charging Stations (FCSs), have emerged, holding the promise to accelerate the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs). These technologies address critical challenges such as range anxiety and charging downtime, contributing to a seamless experience for EV users. This work primarily delves into the realm of FCS, recognized as one of the most readily available options in the current market. Optimizing the utilization of charging infrastructure hinges on tackling challenges related to routing EVs to the nearest FCS capable of meeting specific charging requirements. These requirements encompass factors such as wait time, charging duration, and charging cost. In addition to the integration of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications for enhancing EV routing to FCS, coordinated management of EV charging demand becomes imperative for achieving grid load balancing and preventing grid overload.

        "abstract": "The advent of the fifth-generation mobile communication technology (5G) era has catalyzed significant advancements in medical diagnosis delivery, primarily driven by the surge in medical data from wearable Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. Nonetheless, the IoMT paradigm grapples with challenges related to data security, privacy, constrained computational capabilities at the edge, and an inadequate architecture for handling traditionally error-prone data. In this context, our research offers: (1) an exhaustive review of large-scale medical data propelled by IoMT, (2) an exploration of the prevailing cloud-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework tailored for IoMT, and (3) an insight into the application of Edge Federated Learning (EFL) in bolstering medical big data analytics to yield secure and superior diagnostic outcomes. We place a particular emphasis on the proliferation of IoMT wearable devices that incessantly stream medical data, either from patients or healthcare institutions, to centralized repositories. Furthermore, we introduce a federated cloud-edge AI blueprint designed to position computational resources proximate to the edge network, facilitating real-time diagnostic feedback to patients. We conclude by delineating prospective research trajectories in enhancing IoMT through AI integration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The rise of Generative AI has raised many questions from the perspective of copyright. From the lens of copyright and database rights, issues revolve not only around the authorship of AI-generated outputs, but also the very process that leads to the generation of these outputs, namely the process of text and data mining (TDM). Does unauthorized TDM process infringe the economic rights of the rightholders? How does the TDM-debate transform and transmute in the age of Generative AI? Generative AI tools create works that substitute the content creators whose very work that they learn from, and successively improvise themselves with every iteration. Generative AI, thus, also presents larger policy question as they substitute the romanticized human author that sits at the centre of copyright. In addition, as Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can now also crawl the web, questions thus transcend the frontiers of copyright, and touch upon innovation and competition in the market for web browsers. This research article contemplates on the foregoing issues, and makes some recommendations to create a balanced framework, whereby incentives to innovate are preserved, and the interests of the human author are suitably safeguarded in the age of TDM and Generative AI.",

        "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between Standard Public Open Licences (SPOLs) and inequity in the artificial intelligence (AI) innovation ecosystem, focusing on how these licences affect access to and use of African datasets. While SPOLs are widely promoted as tools for democratising data access, they often apply uniform conditions to all users, disregarding disparities in infrastructure, capacity and socioeconomic context. As a result, SPOLs may unintentionally reinforce exclusion and enable extractive data practices that disadvantage communities contributing valuable datasets that they have preserved and curated through historically challenging conditions. The study employs a desktop literature review of primary and secondary sources, complemented by analysis of specific case studies from the Masakhane Research Collective in Natural Language Processing and qualitative vignettes based on real-world experiences to identify inherent and systemic limitations of current SPOLs. The research shows how existing SPOLs, particularly those founded on copyright law, fail to accommodate the positionality of African and similarly situated users in the global data economy. In response, the article introduces the Nwulite Obodo Open Data Licence (NOODL Licence), a novel, tiered SPOL designed to foster equitable openness. NOODL differentiates conditions of use based on users\u2019 geography and development context, incorporating benefit-sharing obligations and context-sensitive terms. It maintains the simplicity and legal clarity of existing SPOLs while addressing their inequities. By critically analysing the overlooked relationship between SPOLs and inequity, this article contributes a practical, context-aware licensing alternative that centres communities. While grounded in the African experience, the NOODL framework offers a replicable model for promoting fairness and inclusivity in global data governance and AI innovation.",
