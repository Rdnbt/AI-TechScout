However, AR-HUD systems still face great challenges in the realization of multi-plane full-color display, and they cannot truly achieve the integration of virtual information and real road conditions. To overcome these problems, many new devices and materials have been applied to AR-HUDs, and many novel systems have been developed. This study first reviews some key metrics of HUDs, investigates the structures of various picture generation units (PGUs), and finally focuses on the development status of AR-HUDs, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing technologies, and points out the future research directions for AR-HUDs.",

        "abstract": "The conceptual framework for assessing the situational awareness (SA) of drivers consists of three hierarchical levels: perception of the elements of the environment, comprehension of the elements, and decision-making in the near future. A common challenge in evaluating SA is the determination of the available subjective and objective techniques and their selection and integration into methodologies. Among the objective techniques, eye tracking is commonly used, considering the influence of gaze behavior on driving. This review is presented as an innovative approach to the subject matter, introducing physiological metrics based on eye tracking and investigating their application in assessing the SA of drivers. In addition, experiments and methodologies that revealed patterns at the three levels of SA were identified. For this purpose, databases were searched, and 38 papers were considered. Articles were clustered according to prevalent themes such as eye-tracking metrics, eye-tracking devices, experiment design, and the relationship between SA and eye-tracking. This review summarizes the main metrics and key findings for each article and reveals a wide relationship between the eye-tracking metrics and SA. The influence of appropriately calibrated equipment, refined data collection protocols, and adequate selection of the eye-tracking metrics was examined. Further reviews are needed to systematically collect more evidence.",

        "abstract": "Radical left culture and heritage\u2014understood as incarnations of leftist artefacts and praxis both past and present\u2014have taken risks in challenging hegemonic machinations often when it is unpopular to do so. To the ire of hegemons, leftist projects across the globe have marshalled places, spaces, and technologies into sites of empowerment and struggle utilising \u2018small\u2019 and \u2018big\u2019 acts of resistance and critical interventions to champion social justice\u2014sometimes successfully, and at other times, less so. However, the preservation of projects\u2019 artefacts, praxis, and memory work has been anything but straightforward, owing primarily to institutional politics and infrastructural and resourcing issues. Taking The Freedom Archives (FA) as a case study, this article explores how FA is preserving the distinctive political education programme that underpinned the iconic liberation struggle in Guinea-Bissau that kickstarted the seismic, global decolonisation project in the late 1950s. The article argues that FA could substantially enhance the preservation and memorialisation of that programme in the Metaverse\u2014if this materialises as a fully open, interoperable, and highly immersive space (1) unfettered by hegemonic regulation, and (2) characterised by \u2018strategic witnessing\u2019, \u2018radical recordkeeping\u2019, and user agency. In doing so, FA would serve as an exemplar for leftist projects globally.",

        "abstract": "Driver intention recognition is essential for optimizing driving decisions by dynamically adjusting speed and trajectory to enhance system performance. However, in the underground coal mine environment, traditional vision-based methods face significant limitations in accuracy and adaptability. To effectively improve the accuracy of vision-based driver intention recognition, this study introduces a novel approach leveraging cross-modal knowledge distillation (CMKD) to integrate electroencephalography (EEG) signals with video data to identify driver intentions in coal mining operations. By combining these modalities, the method capitalizes on their complementary strengths to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of driver intent. Experimental analysis across various models evaluates the performance of the proposed CMKD method, which integrates EEG signals with video data. Results reveal a substantial improvement in recognition accuracy over traditional machine vision-based approaches, with a maximum accuracy of 84.38%. This advancement enhances the reliability of driver intention detection and offers more robust support for decision making in automated mine transport systems.",

This study systematically explored the role of multimodal interaction in building trust, analyzed interaction design strategies for different driving scenarios, and experimentally verified the significant effect of multimodal feedback on improving user trust. The results show that reasonable multimodal interaction design can enhance users' understanding and prediction of system behavior, reduce uncertainty anxiety, and accelerate trust restoration in abnormal situations. At the same time, the study also revealed issues such as sensor fusion accuracy and ethical privacy faced by current technologies and envisioned future development directions such as anthropomorphic interaction and contextual awareness. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the interaction design of autonomous driving systems, which is of great value in promoting the commercialization of the technology.",

        "title": "From Automation to Augmentation: Redefining Engineering Design and Manufacturing in the Age of NextGen-AI",
        "abstract": "In the mid-2010s, as computing and other digital technologies matured (), researchers began to speculate about a new era of innovation\u2014with artificial intelligence (AI) as the standard-bearer of a \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\" (). The release of generative AI (Gen-AI) technologies (e.g., ChatGPT) in late 2022 reignited the discussion, prompting us to wonder: what are the barriers, risks, and potential rewards to using gen-AI for design and manufacturing? As Gen-AI has entered the mainstream, geopolitics and business practices have shifted. Covid-19 disrupted global supply chains, tensions with import partners have risen, and military conflicts introduce new uncertainties. As companies consider propositions like 'reshoring' or 'nearshoring/friendshoring' production (), we recognize other hindrances: suboptimal resource allocation, labor market volatility and trends toward an older and geographically mismatched workforce, and highly concentrated tech markets that foster anticompetitive business practices. As the United States expands domestic production capacity (e.g., semiconductors and electric vehicles), Gen-AI could help us overcome those challenges. To investigate the current and potential usefulness of Gen-AI in design and manufacturing, we interviewed industry experts\u2014including engineers, manufacturers, tech executives, and entrepreneurs. They have identified many opportunities for the deployment of Gen-AI: (1) reducing the incidence of costly late-stage design changes when scaling production; (2) providing information to designers and engineers, including identifying suitable design spaces and material formulations and incorporating consumer preferences; (3) improving test data interpretation to enable rapid validation and qualification; (4) democratizing workers' access and usage of data to enable real-time insights and process adjustment; and (5) empowering less-skilled workers to be more productive and do more-expert work. Current Gen-AI solutions (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) cannot accomplish these goals due to several key deficiencies, including the inability to provide robust, reliable, and replicable output; lack of relevant domain knowledge; unawareness of industry-standards requirements for product quality; failure to integrate seamlessly with existing workflow; and inability to simultaneously interpret data from different sources and formats. We propose a development framework for the next generation of Gen-AI tools for design and manufacturing (\"NextGen-AI\"): (1) provide better information about engineering tools, repositories, search methods, and other resources to augment the creative process of design; (2) integrate adherence to first principles when solving engineering problems; (3) leverage employees' experiential knowledge to improve training and performance; (4) empower workers to perform new and more-expert productive tasks rather than pursue static automation of workers' current functions; (5) create a collaborative and secure data ecosystem to train foundation models; and (6) ensure that new tools are safe and effective. These goals are extensive and will require broad-based buy-in from business leaders, operators, researchers, engineers, and policymakers. We recommend the following priorities to enable useful AI for design and manufacturing: (1) improve systems integration to ethically collect real-time data, (2) regulate data governance to ensure equal opportunity in development and ownership, (3) expand the collection of worker-safety data to assess industry-wide AI usage, (4) include engineers and operators in the development and uptake of new tools, and (5) focus on skills-complementary deployments to maximize productivity upside.",

        "abstract": "This study demonstrates the multifunctional performance of innovative 2D auxetic lattices through a combination of multiscale experiments, finite element modeling and data-driven prediction. A geometric modeling approach utilizing Voronoi partitioning and a unique branch-stem-branch (BSB) structure, patterned according to 2D wallpaper symmetries, enables precise concurrent geometric and topological tuning of lattices across a continuous parameter space. Selected architectures are physically realized via material extrusion of polylactic acid (PLA) infused with carbon black (CB). Experimental characterizations, supported by Finite Element modeling, reveal the significant influence of BSB structure's design parameters on mechanical and piezoresistive performance under tensile loading, with a remarkable Poisson\u2019s ratio of -0.74, accompanied by a 15-fold increase in elastic stiffness and a 34-fold increase in strain sensitivity. Additionally, architecturally, and topologically tailored lattice structures exhibit tunable damage sensitivity, reflecting the rate of conductive network destruction within the lattice. This offers insights into the rapidity of cell wall failure, with a steeper slope of the piezoresistance curve in the inelastic regime indicating a faster breakdown and quicker onset of mechanical failure. Integration of Gaussian Process Regression enables accurate exploration of the design space beyond realized structures, highlighting the potential of these intelligent lattice structures for applications such as sensors and in situ health monitoring, marking a significant advancement in multifunctional materials.",

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is a technology that creates objects by adding successive layers of material. The 3D method is an alternative to subtractive production, in which production involves removing material from the initial solid. 3D printing requires the initial design of the manufactured object using computer design, for example, one of the following programs: CAD, 3DCrafter, Wings 3D, Cinema 3, Blender, 3ds Max, Autodesk Inventor, and others. It is also possible to scan an existing object to be manufactured using 3D printing technology. An important element of Industry 5.0 is 3D printing technology, due to its favorable environmental orientation and production flexibility. Three-dimensional printing technology uses recycled materials such as powders. Therefore, it can be part of a circular economy, contributing to environmental protection. Additive manufacturing not only complements existing technologies by enabling rapid prototyping but also plays a fundamental role in sectors such as dentistry and medicine. This article consists of seven chapters relating to various aspects of 3D printing technology in the context of the assumptions and challenges of Industry 5.0. It examines the environmental impact and recycling potential of 3D printing technology, illustrates the economic integration of this technology within various industries, and discusses its future development prospects.",

The study included a total of 382 samples that included both teachers and students. Survey respondents are qualified teachers with at least 10 years of teaching experience, as determined through sampling. Participants responded to a study questionnaire that was used to collect data. Data were collected using Smart PLS software, which included validity and reliability assessments and hypothesis tests. The results of the study indicated that the dissemination of learning technology is directly affected by teacher leadership and student participation, which affects its effectiveness. Instructor leadership, student engagement, and successful use of learning technologies directly impact the online learning environment. The use of learning technology is influenced by teacher leadership, curriculum, and student engagement, which ultimately impacts the online learning environment. This study suggests two main results. To enhance the efficiency of learning technology deployment, the focus of public policy should be on enhancing teacher leadership and student performance. Moreover, enhancing the efficient use of learning technology is a critical policy goal to improve the quality of the online learning environment. Students and teachers with enhanced skills should collaborate to share their technological learning materials and management practices to improve students' online learning experiences.

        "abstract": "Global resource extraction raises concerns about environmental pressures and the security of mineral supply. Strategies to address these concerns depend on robust information on natural resource endowments, and on suitable methods to monitor and model their changes over time. However, current mineral resources and reserves reporting and accounting workflows are poorly suited for addressing mineral depletion or answering questions about the long-term sustainable supply. Our integrative review finds that the lack of a robust theoretical concept and framework for mass-balance (MB)-consistent geological stock accounting hinders systematic industry-government data integration, resource governance, and strategy development. We evaluate the existing literature on geological stock accounting, identify shortcomings of current monitoring of mine production, and outline a conceptual framework for MB-consistent system integration based on material flow analysis (MFA). Our synthesis shows that recent developments in Earth observation, geoinformation management, and sustainability reporting act as catalysts that make MB-consistent geological stock accounting increasingly feasible. We propose first steps for its implementation and anticipate that our perspective as \"resource realists\" will facilitate the integration of geological and anthropogenic material systems, help secure future mineral supply, and support the global sustainability transition.",

        "abstract": "Advanced manufacturing research for sustainable battery life cycles is of utmost importance to reach net zero carbon emissions ( European Commission, 2023a ) as well as several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), for example: 30% reduction of CO 2 emission, 10 million job opportunities and access to electricity for 600 million people ( World Economic Forum, 2019 ). This editorial paper highlights international motivations for pursuing more sustainable manufacturing practices and discusses key research topics in battery manufacturing. Batteries will be central to our sustainable future as generation and storage become key components to on-demand energy supply. Four underlying themes are identified to address industrial needs in this field: 1. Digitalizing and automating production capabilities: data-driven solutions for production quality, smart maintenance, automation, and human factors, 2. Human-centric production: extended reality for operator support and skills development, 3. Circular battery life cycles: circular battery systems supported by service-based and other novel business models, 4. Future topics for battery value chains: increased industrial resilience and transparency with digital product passports, and next-generation battery chemistries. Challenges and opportunities along these themes are highlighted for transforming battery value chains through circularity and more sustainable production, with a particular emphasis on lithium-ion batteries (LIB). The paper concludes with directions for further research to advance a circular and sustainable battery value chain through utilizing the full potential of digitalization realising a cleaner, more energy-efficient society.",
