Holographic waveguides, despite longer timelines, represent critical immersive AR technology for medium-term innovation and are included to maintain a leadership position in display technology.",
    "resource_allocation_suggestion": "Allocate approximately 50% of R&D and investment resources to full-windshield AR projection to capitalize on OEM momentum and market readiness. Dedicate 30% to eye-tracking technologies to enhance safety and adaptive systems integration. Reserve 20% for advancing holographic waveguide displays to secure long-term technological leadership and differentiation."
