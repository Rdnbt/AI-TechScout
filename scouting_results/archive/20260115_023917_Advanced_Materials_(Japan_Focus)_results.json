        "abstract": "Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) is a photocrosslinkable biomaterial that has gained widespread use in tissue engineering due to its favorable biological attributes and customizable physical and mechanical traits. While GelMA is compatible with various cell types, distinct cellular responses are observed within GelMA hydrogels. As such, tailoring hydrogels for specific applications has become imperative. Thus, our objective was to develop GelMA hydrogels tailored to enhance cell viability specifically for TC28a2 chondrocytes in a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture setting. We investigated GelMA synthesis using PBS and 0.25M CB buffer, analyzed the mechanical and physical traits of GelMA hydrogels, and evaluated how varying GelMA crosslinking conditions (GelMA concentration, photoinitiator concentration, and UV exposure time) affected the viability of TC28a2 chondrocytes. The results revealed that GelMA synthesis using 0.25M CB buffer led to a greater degree of methacrylation compared to PBS buffer, and the LAP photoinitiator demonstrated superior efficacy for GelMA gelation compared to Irgacure 2959. Additionally, the stiffness, porosity, and swelling degree of GelMA hydrogels were predominantly affected by GelMA concentration, while cell viability was impacted by all crosslinking conditions, decreasing notably with increasing GelMA concentration, photoinitiator concentration, and UV exposure time. This study facilitated the optimization of crosslinking conditions to enhance cell viability within GelMA hydrogels, a critical aspect for diverse biomedical applications.",

However, an emerging technology known as 3D printing (3DP) can play a significant role and rapidly bring unlimited innovative solutions in such conditions with much lesser resources to meet the necessities of large populations affected. Considering the recent progress of 3DP technology and applications in different industrial and consumer sectors, this study aims to provide an analysis of the status and current progress of 3DP technology in various fields to understand and present its potential for readiness and response to disasters, emergency and relief need driven by climate change. Secondly, this study also presents a sustainability assessment of 3DP technology for such cases to evaluate economic, environmental, and social impacts. Finally, policies and strategies are suggested to adapt 3DP technology in different sectors to prepare for large-scale emergencies.",

        "abstract": "The DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst), DPF (diesel particulate filter), SCR (selective catalytic reduction), and ASC (ammonia slip catalyst) are widely used in diesel exhaust after-treatment systems. The thermal management of after-treatment systems using DOC, DPF, SCR, and ASC were investigated to improve the efficiency of these devices. This paper aims to identify the challenges of this topic and seek novel methods to control the temperature. Insulation methods and catalysts decrease the energy required for thermal management, which improves the efficiency of thermal management. Thermal insulation decreases the heat loss of the exhaust gas, which can reduce the after-treatment light-off time. The DOC light-off time was reduced by 75% under adiabatic conditions. A 400 W microwave can heat the DPF to the soot oxidation temperature of 873 K at a regeneration time of 150 s. An SCR burner can decrease NOx emissions by 93.5%. Electrically heated catalysts can decrease CO, HC, and NOx emissions by 80%, 80%, and 66%, respectively. Phase-change materials can control the SCR temperature with a two-thirds reduction in NOx emissions. Pt-Pd application in the catalyst can decrease the CO light-off temperature to 113 \u00b0C. Approaches of catalysts can enhance the efficiency of the after-treatment systems and reduce the energy consumption of thermal management.",

        "title": "Durability Improvement of Pumice Lightweight Aggregate Concrete by Incorporating Modified Rubber Powder with Sodium Silicate",
        "abstract": "To improve the durability of pumice lightweight aggregate concrete applied in cold and drought areas, sodium silicate-modified waste tire rubber powder is used to treat the pumice lightweight aggregate concrete. The pumice lightweight aggregate concrete studied is mainly used in river lining structures. It will be eroded by water flow and the impact of ice and other injuries, resulting in reduced durability, and the addition of modified rubber will reduce the damage. The durability, including mass loss rate and relative dynamic elastic modulus of pumice lightweight aggregate concrete with different sodium silicate dosages and rubber power particle sizes, is analyzed under freeze-thaw cycles, and the microstructure is further characterized by using microscopic test methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance tests, ultra-depth 3D microscope tests, and scanning electron microscopy tests. The results showed that the durability of pumice lightweight aggregate concrete is significantly improved by the addition of modified waste tire rubber powder, and the optimum durability is achieved when using 2 wt% sodium silicate modified rubber power with a particle size of 20, and then the mass loss rate decreased from 4.54% to 0.77% and the relative dynamic elastic modulus increased from 50.34% to 64.87% after 300 freeze-thaw cycles compared with other samples. The scanning electron microscopy test result showed that the surface of rubber power is cleaner after the modification of sodium silicate, so the bonding ability between rubber power and cement hydration products is improved, which further improved the durability of concrete under the freeze-thaw cycle. The results of the nuclear magnetic resonance test showed that the pore area increased with the number of freeze-thaw cycles, and the small pores gradually evolved into large pores. The effect of sodium silicate on the modification of rubber power with different particle sizes is different. After the treatment of 2 wt% sodium silicate, the relationship between the increased rate of pore area and the number of freezing-thawing cycles is 23.8/times for the pumice lightweight aggregate concrete containing rubber power with a particle size of 20 and 35.3/times for the pumice lightweight aggregate concrete containing a particle size of 80 rubber power, respectively.",

The MFCs were inoculated with G. sulfurreducens, kaolin (12.5 g\u00b7L\u22121), and three different concentrations of graphite (0.25, 1.25, and 2.5 g\u00b7L\u22121). The modified anode with the graphite nanoparticles (1.25 g\u00b7L\u22121) showed the highest electroactivity and biofilm viability. A potential of 0.59, 0.45, and 0.23 V and a power density of 0.54 W\u00b7m\u22122, 0.3 W\u00b7m\u22122, and 0.2 W\u00b7m\u22122 were obtained by the MFCs based on kaolin\u2013graphite nanoparticles, kaolin, and bare anodes, respectively. The kaolin\u2013graphite anode exhibited the highest Coulombic efficiency (21%) compared with the kaolin (17%) and the bare (14%) anodes. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a large amount of biofilm on the kaolin\u2013graphite anode. We assume that the graphite nanoparticles increased the charge transfer between the bacteria that are in the biofilm and are far from the anode material. The addition of kaolin and graphite nanoparticles increased the attachment of several bacteria. Thus, for MFCs that are fed with wastewater, the modified anode should be prepared with a pure culture of G. sulfurreducens before adding wastewater that includes non-exoelectrogenic bacteria.",

Firstly, an indicator system of the digital economy is constructed from five aspects: digital infrastructure construction, digitalization level of society, growth of the economy promoted by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), development level of digital economy industries, and capitalization level of digital economy enterprises. Secondly, we use Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence and time-difference correlation coefficient to classify the indicators, and construct a prosperity index. Thirdly, this paper establishes Grey-Markov model combining grey system and Markov chain, further uses this model to predict the development level of digital economy. The empirical analysis shows the Grey-Markov model is superior to grey prediction model in capturing random fluctuations, and Monte Carlo simulation indicates that this model has good robustness. It finds that the gradual deceleration of development will make digital economy close to the relatively stagnant period, although its development level remains stable in the next two years. This research will provide theoretical basis of decisions for government departments, and offer strategic support of the digital transformation for enterprises.",

        "abstract": "Herein, the study explores a composite modification approach to enhance the use of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in sustainable construction by combining accelerated carbonation (AC) and nano-silica immersion (NS). RCA, a major source of construction waste, faces challenges in achieving comparable properties to virgin aggregates. Nano-silica, a potent pozzolan, is added to fill micro-cracks and voids in RCA, improving its bonding and strength. AC pretreatment accelerates RCA\u2019s natural carbonation, forming calcium carbonate that strengthens the aggregate and reduces porosity. Due to the complexity of the original RCA, a laboratory-simulated RCA (LS-RCA) is used in this study for the mechanism analysis. Experimental trials employing the composite methodology have exhibited noteworthy enhancements, with the crushing index diminishing by approximately 23% and water absorption rates decreasing by up to 30%. Notably, the modification efficacy is more pronounced when applied to RCA derived from common-strength concrete (w/c of 0.5) as compared to high-strength concrete (w/c of 0.35). This disparity stems from the inherently looser structural framework and greater abundance of detrimental crystal structures in the former, which impede strength. Through a synergistic interaction, the calcium carbonate content undergoes a substantial increase, nearly doubling, while the proportion of calcium hydrate undergoes a concurrent reduction of approximately 30%. Furthermore, the combined modification effect leads to a 15% reduction in total porosity and a constriction of the average pore diameter by roughly 20%, ultimately resulting in pore refinement that equates the performance of samples with a water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 to those with a ratio of 0.35. This remarkable transformation underscores the profound modification potential of the combination approach. This study underscores the efficacy of harnessing accelerated carbonation in conjunction with nano-silica as a strategic approach to optimizing the utilization of RCA in concrete mixes, thereby bolstering their performance metrics and enhancing sustainability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to optimise the protein extraction yield from black soldier fly larvae by employing a blanching process to enhance protein solubility and mitigate oxidation. Through response surface methodology, we determined the optimal blanching conditions, with the temperature set at 85.152 \u00b0C, a duration of 12.411 s, and a sodium chloride concentration of 0.46 M. These parameters were selected to maximise protein solubility while minimising oxidation. The results of this study reveal significant improvements in protein functionality after blanching, particularly with respect to increased emulsification stability. Notably, no significant effect on foam formation was observed. These findings underscore the efficacy of blanching as a pre-processing step to enhance the quality of proteins extracted from black soldier fly larvae. Moreover, these optimised conditions have promising applications in various food and feed formulations, contributing to sustainable protein sourcing and processing methods. By addressing key challenges related to food security and environmental sustainability, this study provides valuable insights into the utilisation of insect proteins as an alternative protein source in the face of global challenges, such as climate change and dwindling natural resources.",

        "abstract": "The advent of flying taxis, also known as vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, presents a revolutionary approach to urban transportation by offering faster, more flexible, and less congested travel options. This research aims to explore the potential impact of flying taxis on urban transportation systems, focusing on their implementation, regulation, and benefits across various industries. This study investigates the role of government in monitoring and regulating flying taxis to ensure safety and compliance with regulations, addressing key considerations such as licensing, air traffic control, safety standards, insurance requirements, and privacy concerns. Through a comprehensive review of the existing literature and case studies, this paper presents the advantages of flying taxis, including time savings, accessibility to remote areas, reduced traffic congestion, and enhanced travel experiences. Additionally, the economic benefits of manufacturing flying taxis, such as job creation and technological advancements, are discussed. The findings suggest that flying taxis have significant potential to transform urban transportation, but their adoption requires collaboration among stakeholders, robust regulatory frameworks, and substantial infrastructure investments. The conclusions highlight the practical application value of flying taxis in promoting sustainable urban mobility and driving innovation in transportation.",

The first is chemical degradation by highly reactive compounds formed during combustion, in particular, during the incineration of municipal or industrial wastes or high-sulfur coal. The degradation intensity of electrostatic precipitator electrodes depends on the chemical composition of the exhaust gasses. High concentrations of chlorides, fluorides, or sulfur in the exhaust gasses cause strong corrosion of the electrostatic precipitator elements. The second mechanism is the erosion caused by solid particles conveyed by the exhaust gas stream due to their collision with the electrodes. In this study, the analysis of the degradation of electrodes of an electrostatic precipitator downstream of an industrial waste incinerator was carried out. The industrial wastes of unknown sources were subjected to thermal degradation in a rotary kiln. The aim of this study was to provide fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms of electrode degradation located on the surface of discharge electrodes of electrostatic precipitators during the combustion of industrial wastes.",

However, defects such as overheating, residual stresses, distortions, porosity, and a non-homogeneous microstructure limit its commercial applications. Therefore, the present study aims to analyze the correlation between electrical sensing anomalies in the Gas Metal Arc (GMA) during WAAM and the occurrence of microscopic defects caused by external contamination. To achieve this, experiments were conducted to fabricate walls using WAAM with controlled contaminant introduction. Simultaneously, electrical arc data, specifically voltage and current, were segmented and acquired during the wall deposition process. Metallographic analysis confirmed the presence of microscopic defects or changes in the solidification patterns in regions with contaminant inclusion, distinguishing them from other areas of the analyzed samples. Similarly, the contaminations were proven to cause anomalies in attributes associated with the electrical arc. Therefore, this approach confirms the criticality of electrical arc monitoring in WAAM, as it demonstrates that anomalies in the electrical arc could lead to microstructural consequences.",

        "abstract": "Waste valorization is necessary in today\u2019s society to achieve a sustainable economy and prosperity. In this work, a novel approach to the waste valorization of cuttlebone was investigated. This material was ground and calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h in an inert atmosphere. The resulting calcined cuttlebone (CCB) was characterized using XRD, SEM, FTIR, BET, TGA, Zetasizer, and potential methods. The main phases in the CCB were determined to be CaO, MgO, Ca3(PO4)2, and residual carbon. CCB was investigated as an adsorbent for the removal of dye from simulated wastewater streams. The maximum adsorption capacities for rhodamine B and crystal violet dyes were estimated to be 519 and 921 mg/g, respectively. For both dyes, the Avrami model was the best-fit model for representing adsorption kinetics. The study of adsorbent regeneration for CV as a representative example involved the use of several chemical solvents. Ethanol solvent was shown to have the highest adsorbent regeneration method efficiency, reaching 65.20%. In addition, CCB was investigated for methanol electro-oxidation for energy generation. As the methanol concentration increased, the maximum current density produced by the CCB increased, reaching approximately 50 mA/cm2. This work paves the way toward waste valorization of natural matter for sustainable production and consumption of material, as per the requirements of the circular economy principles.",

        "abstract": "The article presents study results showing the increasing role of unregulated activity as a boost for innovative processes in energy companies and their investment appeal. A summary of academic literature, reports by leading consulting companies, and international energy agencies make it possible to outline the landscape of the most economically viable areas of business activity in the energy industry, the most promising of which are energy efficiency, design and deployment of EV charging networks, smart grids, and telecom services. Analysis of financial performance statements of over 30 energy companies from different countries demonstrates the contribution of unregulated activities to their financial stability, which shows in growing profits, capitalization, and stock prices. It is revealed that despite the active promotion of unregulated activities by the state that primarily seeks to achieve the goals of the low-carbon transition, there is a stronger government presence in the capital structure of energy companies, which in the future will slow down investment activity in the industry. In this regard, the discussion considers the barriers to organizing unregulated business in the electricity sector and methods to eliminate them. In particular, a set of necessary conditions is defined, under which entrepreneurship in the industry contributes to improving the efficiency of the main business processes\u2014production and transportation of energy.",

        "title": "Characterization of Volatile Organic Compounds and Aroma of Eight Bamboo Species Leaves",
        "abstract": "Bamboo forest healthcare tourism is a practical and sustainable management model that utilizes the medicinal functions of bamboo. However, the mechanism and potential functions of bamboo\u2019s healthcare functions are still unclear. In this study, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are the core factor of bamboo forest healthcare were analyzed. The foliar VOCs of eight bamboo species, including Pleioblastus amarus (Keng) P. C. Keng, Pleioblastus maculatus (McClure) C. D. Chu et C. S. Chao, Pleioblastus juxianensis T. H. Wen, C. Y. Yao et S. Y. Chen, Acidosasa chienouensis (T. H. Wen) C. S. Chao et T. H. Wen, Pseudosasa amabilis (McClure) P. C. Keng ex S. L. Chen et al., Pseudosasa amabilis (McClure) Keng f., Phyllostachys rubromarginata McClure, and Phyllostachys hirtivagina G. H. Lai were qualitatively and semi-quantitatively analyzed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME)\u2013gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Screening compounds by aroma vitality value (OAV) determined the key aromas. The results showed that a total of 40 VOCs were identified from the leaves of the eight bamboo species. The compounds with relatively high content were (Z)-3-Hexen-1-ol, (E)-2-Hexen-1-ol, 1-Hexanol, (E, E)-2,4-Hexadienal, Limonene, and so on. The commonality of different bamboo species was that the dominant groups consisted of alcohols and aldehydes. The significant differences in leaf VOCs among species presented classification. Pleioblastus amarus, Acidosasa chienouensis, Pseudosasa amabilis, and Phyllostachys rubromarginata were noticeably clustered together. The aroma of bamboo leaves is a combination of grassy, fruity, and piney notes by 24 VOCs. The key aroma from Pleioblastus amarus is leaf alcohol, which contributes to the grassy scent, while the piney aroma is dominant in Pseudosasa amabilis and Phyllostachys rubromarginata. The study provides a reference value for enriching the chemical information of subtropical bamboo and developing the functional potential of bamboo forest healthcare tourism.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a major public health concern with over 200 million new cases annually, resulting in significant financial costs. Preventive measures and diagnostic remedies are crucial in saving lives from malaria, and especially in developing nations. 2D materials are, therefore, ideal for fighting such an epidemic. Graphene and its derivatives are extensively studied due to their exceptional properties in this case. The biomedical applications of graphene\u2010based nanomaterials have gained significant interest in recent years due to their remarkable biocompatibility, solubility, and selectivity. Their unique physicochemical characteristics, like ample surface area, biofunctionality, high purity, solubility, substantial drug\u2010loading capacity, and superior ability to penetrate cell membranes, make them up\u2010and\u2010coming candidates as biodelivery carriers. In this review, crucial graphene\u2010based technologies to combat malaria are discussed. The advancements in preventing and diagnosing malaria and the biocompatibility of graphene\u2010based nanomaterials are emphasized. The roadmap for using graphene\u2010based technology toward achieving the WHO global malaria elimination by 2030 is presented and discussed in detail. Graphene oxide, the most critical biocompatible graphene derivative for health sensors, is also discussed. Additionally, 2D chalcogenides, specifically sulfide\u2010based transition\u2010metal dichalcogenides, are reviewed in detecting malaria during its early stages.",

        "abstract": "The Intelligent Manufacturing for Extreme Environments (IMEE) workshop was held at the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) in Idaho Falls, Idaho, May 2\u20133, 2023, in support of the United States (U.S.) National Science Foundation (NSF) Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research: Workshop Opportunities (EPSCoR-WO) program. This workshop featured keynote speakers, panels, and breakout sessions with 58 participants. Nuclear reactors need to operate under extreme service conditions, such as high temperatures, corrosive environments, and high-radiation doses. Hence, reactor components must be able to withstand those conditions. The participants envision a future where on demand manufacture of components for small modular reactors (SMRs), microreactors, and other advanced reactor designs are possible. In this future, regulatory bodies accept validated manufacturing processes and standardized feedstocks, thus eliminating the need for individual component testing. However, the necessary technologies and regulatory policies needed for this future do not exist today. Successful innovation would revolutionize the nuclear power sector, enable fast commercial development, create economic opportunities in the U.S., reduce the carbon footprint and associated risks, and promote a skilled and highly competitive workforce. The objective of the workshop was to convene world-class experts, researchers, educators, and students to identify gaps and envision solutions for five interrelated challenges for intelligent manufacturing in extreme environments. The key outcomes of the conference were: (1) to take the opportunity for researchers and educators to network and form collaborations; and (2) to produce a full report to inform policy-makers, industry, and the academic community of various challenges and opportunities in the nuclear energy sector.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrated extraordinary capability in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including language translation, text generation, question answering, etc. Moreover, LLMs are new and essential part of computerized language processing, having the ability to understand complex verbal patterns and generate coherent and appropriate replies in a given context. Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a plethora of research on LLMs have been appeared within a short time, it is quite impossible to track all of these and get an overview of the current state of research in this area. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLMs training phase. Then the paper provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper also demonstrates the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. The study also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Finally, the paper also explores open issues and challenges to deploy LLMs in real-world scenario. Our review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella is a major foodborne pathogen and a leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Salmonella is highly pathogenic and encompasses more than 2600 characterized serovars. The transmission of Salmonella to humans occurs through the farm-to-fork continuum and is commonly linked to the consumption of animal-derived food products. Among these sources, poultry and poultry products are primary contributors, followed by beef, pork, fish, and non-animal-derived food such as fruits and vegetables. While antibiotics constitute the primary treatment for salmonellosis, the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella strains have highlighted the urgency of developing antibiotic alternatives. Effective infection management necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the pathogen\u2019s epidemiology and transmission dynamics. Therefore, this comprehensive review focuses on the epidemiology, sources of infection, risk factors, transmission dynamics, and the host range of Salmonella serotypes. This review also investigates the disease characteristics observed in both humans and animals, antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis, and potential strategies for treatment and control of salmonellosis, emphasizing the most recent antibiotic-alternative approaches for infection control.",

        "abstract": "Effectively reducing climate change requires marked, global behavior change. However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors. Here, we tested 11 expert-crowdsourced interventions on four climate mitigation outcomes: beliefs, policy support, information sharing intention, and an effortful tree-planting behavioral task. Across 59,440 participants from 63 countries, the interventions\u2019 effectiveness was small, largely limited to nonclimate skeptics, and differed across outcomes: Beliefs were strengthened mostly by decreasing psychological distance (by 2.3%), policy support by writing a letter to a future-generation member (2.6%), information sharing by negative emotion induction (12.1%), and no intervention increased the more effortful behavior\u2014several interventions even reduced tree planting. Last, the effects of each intervention differed depending on people\u2019s initial climate beliefs. These findings suggest that the impact of behavioral climate interventions varies across audiences and target behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Soil microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of soil ecosystems. This study aims to explore the effects of microbial fertilizers on improving soil physicochemical properties and promoting plant growth. The results show that the application of microbial fertilizers significantly increases the richness of soil microorganisms, maintains soil microecological balance, and effectively improves the soil environment. Through various secondary metabolites, proteins, and mucilage secreted by the developing plant root system, microbial fertilizers recruit specific fungal microorganisms. These microorganisms, by binding soil particles with their extracellular polysaccharides and entwining them, fix the soil, enhance the stability of soil aggregates, and ameliorate soil compaction. Moreover, after the application of microbial fertilizers, the enriched soil microbial community not only promotes the plant\u2019s absorption and utilization of key elements such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), thereby increasing fruit yield and quality, but also competes with pathogens and induces systemic resistance in plants, effectively warding off pathogenic invasions. This study highlights the potential and importance of microbial fertilizers in promoting sustainable agricultural development, offering new strategies and perspectives for future agricultural production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Establishing appropriate metal-support interactions is imperative for acquiring efficient and corrosion-resistant catalysts for water splitting. Herein, the interaction mechanism between Ru nanoparticles and a series of titanium oxides, including TiO, Ti 4 O 7 and TiO 2, designed via facile non-stoichiometric engineering is systematically studied. Ti 4 O 7, with the unique band structure, high conductivity and chemical stability, endows with ingenious metal-support interaction through interfacial Ti\u2013O\u2013Ru units, which stabilizes Ru species during OER and triggers hydrogen spillover to accelerate HER kinetics. As expected, Ru/Ti 4 O 7 displays ultralow overpotentials of 8 mV and 150 mV for HER and OER with a long operation of 500 h at 10 mA cm \u22122 in acidic media, which is expanded in pH-universal environments. Benefitting from the excellent bifunctional performance, the proton exchange membrane and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer assembled with Ru/Ti 4 O 7 achieves superior performance and robust operation. The work paves the way for efficient energy conversion devices.",

In this study, we collected publicly available information on AI/ML-enabled medical devices approved by the FDA in the United States, as of the latest update on 19 October 2023. We performed comprehensive analysis of a total of 691 FDA-approved artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-enabled medical devices and offer an in-depth analysis of clearance pathways, approval timeline, regulation type, medical specialty, decision type, recall history, etc. We found a significant surge in approvals since 2018, with clear dominance of the radiology specialty in the application of machine learning tools, attributed to the abundant data from routine clinical data. The study also reveals a reliance on the 510(k)-clearance pathway, emphasizing its basis on substantial equivalence and often bypassing the need for new clinical trials. Also, it notes an underrepresentation of pediatric-focused devices and trials, suggesting an opportunity for expansion in this demographic. Moreover, the geographical limitation of clinical trials, primarily within the United States, points to a need for more globally inclusive trials to encompass diverse patient demographics. This analysis not only maps the current landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices but also pinpoints trends, potential gaps, and areas for future exploration, clinical trial practices, and regulatory approaches. In conclusion, our analysis sheds light on the current state of FDA-approved AI/ML-enabled medical devices and prevailing trends, contributing to a wider comprehension.",

It poses a substantial challenge in clinical settings due to its complicated antibiotic resistance mechanisms, biofilm formation, and capacity for persistent infections in both animal and human hosts. Recent studies revealed a potential zoonotic transmission of P. aeruginosa between animals, the environment, and human populations which highlights awareness of this microbe. Implementation of the One Health approach, which underscores the connection between human, animal, and environmental health, we aim to offer a comprehensive perspective on the current landscape of P. aeruginosa management. This review presents innovative strategies designed to counteract P. aeruginosa infections. Traditional antibiotics, while effective in many cases, are increasingly compromised by the development of multidrug-resistant strains. Non-antibiotic avenues, such as quorum sensing inhibition, phage therapy, and nanoparticle-based treatments, are emerging as promising alternatives. However, their clinical application encounters obstacles like cost, side effects, and safety concerns. Effectively addressing P. aeruginosa infections necessitates persistent research efforts, advancements in clinical development, and a comprehension of host-pathogen interactions to deal with this resilient pathogen.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computers offer an intriguing path for a paradigmatic change of computing in the natural sciences and beyond, with the potential for achieving a so-called quantum advantage\u2014namely, a significant (in some cases exponential) speedup of numerical simulations. The rapid development of hardware devices with various realizations of qubits enables the execution of small-scale but representative applications on quantum computers. In particular, the high-energy physics community plays a pivotal role in accessing the power of quantum computing, since the field is a driving source for challenging computational problems. This concerns, on the theoretical side, the exploration of models that are very hard or even impossible to address with classical techniques and, on the experimental side, the enormous data challenge of newly emerging experiments, such as the upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. In this Roadmap paper, led by CERN, DESY, and IBM, we provide the status of high-energy physics quantum computations and give examples of theoretical and experimental target benchmark applications, which can be addressed in the near future. Having in mind hardware with about 100 qubits capable of executing several thousand two-qubit gates, where possible, we also provide resource estimates for the examples given using error-mitigated quantum computing. The ultimate declared goal of this task force is therefore to trigger further research in the high-energy physics community to develop interesting use cases for demonstrations on near-term quantum computers.

        "abstract": "Abstract Achieving a highly robust zinc (Zn) metal anode is extremely important for improving the performance of aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) for advancing \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d society, which is hampered by the uncontrollable growth of Zn dendrite and severe side reactions including hydrogen evolution reaction, corrosion, and passivation, etc. Herein, an interlayer containing fluorinated zincophilic covalent organic framework with sulfonic acid groups (COF-S-F) is developed on Zn metal (Zn@COF-S-F) as the artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Sulfonic acid group (\u2212 SO 3 H) in COF-S-F can effectively ameliorate the desolvation process of hydrated Zn ions, and the three-dimensional channel with fluoride group (-F) can provide interconnected channels for the favorable transport of Zn ions with ion-confinement effects, endowing Zn@COF-S-F with dendrite-free morphology and suppressed side reactions. Consequently, Zn@COF-S-F symmetric cell can stably cycle for 1,000 h with low average hysteresis voltage (50.5 mV) at the current density of 1.5 mA cm \u22122 . Zn@COF-S-F|MnO 2 cell delivers the discharge specific capacity of 206.8 mAh g \u22121 at the current density of 1.2 A g \u22121 after 800 cycles with high-capacity retention (87.9%). Enlightening, building artificial SEI on metallic Zn surface with targeted design has been proved as the effective strategy to foster the practical application of high-performance AZIBs.",

        "abstract": "Reproductive system diseases pose prominent threats to human physical and mental well-being. Besides being influenced by genetic material regulation and changes in lifestyle, the occurrence of these diseases is closely connected to exposure to harmful substances in the environment. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), characterized by hormone-like effects, have a wide range of influences on the reproductive system. EDCs are ubiquitous in the natural environment and are present in a wide range of industrial and everyday products. Currently, thousands of chemicals have been reported to exhibit endocrine effects, and this number is likely to increase as the testing for potential EDCs has not been consistently required, and obtaining data has been limited, partly due to the long latency of many diseases. The ability to avoid exposure to EDCs, especially those of artificially synthesized origin, is increasingly challenging. While EDCs can be divided into persistent and non-persistent depending on their degree of degradation, due to the recent uptick in research studies in this area, we have chosen to focus on the research pertaining to the detrimental effects on reproductive health of exposure to several EDCs that are widely encountered in daily life over the past six years, specifically bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), parabens, pesticides, heavy metals, and so on. By focusing on the impact of EDCs on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which leads to the occurrence and development of reproductive system diseases, this review aims to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of EDCs\u2019 damage to human health and to encourage further in-depth research to clarify the potentially harmful effects of EDC exposure through various other mechanisms. Ultimately, it offers a scientific basis to enhance EDCs risk management, an endeavor of significant scientific and societal importance for safeguarding reproductive health.",

The authors utilized a quantitative method, using a survey instrument for this research. Data for this research were collected from managers working in six different sectors. Subsequently, based on company size, firms were divided into two groups, allowing multi-group analysis of small and medium-sized businesses to explore group differences. Hence, firm size played a moderating role in the conceptualized model. Data analysis was performed on SmartPLS 3, and the results suggest that dimensions of the TOE framework, such as relative advantage, compatibility, sustainable human capital, market and customer demand, and government support, play a significant role in the adoption of AI. Moreover, this study found a significant influence of AI on SMEs\u2019 operational and economic performance. The multi-group analysis (MGA) results reveal significant group differences, with a medium-sized firm strengthening the relationship between relative advantage and AI adoption compared to small-size firms. The findings lead to practical implications for companies on how to increase the adoption of AI to help SMEs embrace their technological challenges in KSA and obtain sustainable business performance to contribute to the economy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The field of omics, driven by advances in high-throughput sequencing, faces a data explosion. This abundance of data offers unprecedented opportunities for predictive modeling in precision medicine, but also presents formidable challenges in data analysis and interpretation. Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques have been partly successful in generating predictive models for omics analysis but exhibit limitations in handling potential relationships within the data for more accurate prediction. This review explores a revolutionary shift in predictive modeling through the application of deep learning (DL), specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using transformation methods such as DeepInsight, omics data with independent variables in tabular (table-like, including vector) form can be turned into image-like representations, enabling CNNs to capture latent features effectively. This approach not only enhances predictive power but also leverages transfer learning, reducing computational time, and improving performance. However, integrating CNNs in predictive omics data analysis is not without challenges, including issues related to model interpretability, data heterogeneity, and data size. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaborations between ML experts, bioinformatics researchers, biologists, and medical doctors. This review illuminates these complexities and charts a course for future research to unlock the full predictive potential of CNNs in omics data analysis and related fields.",

        "abstract": "Polymeric nanofibers have emerged as a captivating medium for crafting structures with biomedical applications. Spinning methods have garnered substantial attention in the context of medical applications and neural tissue engineering, ultimately leading to the production of polymer fibers. In comparison with polymer microfibers, polymer nanofibers boasting nanometer-scale diameters offer significantly larger surface areas, facilitating enhanced surface functionalization. Consequently, polymer nanofiber mats are presently undergoing rigorous evaluation for a myriad of applications, including filters, scaffolds for tissue engineering, protective equipment, reinforcement in composite materials, and sensors. This review offers an exhaustive overview of the latest advancements in polymer nanofiber processing and characterization. Additionally, it engages in a discourse regarding research challenges, forthcoming developments in polymer nanofiber production, and diverse polymer types and its applications. Electrospinning has been used to convert a broad range of polymers into nanoparticle nanofibers, and it may be the only approach with significant potential for industrial manufacturing. The basics of these spinning techniques, highlighting the biomedical uses as well as nanostructured fibers for drug delivery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and bio-sensing have been explored.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Piezoelectric actuators are a class of actuators that precisely transfer input electric energy into displacement, force, or movement outputs efficiently via inverse piezoelectric effect-based electromechanical coupling. Various types of piezoelectric actuators have sprung up and gained widespread use in various applications in terms of compelling attributes, such as high precision, flexibility of stoke, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and structural scalability. This paper systematically reviews the piezoelectric materials, operating principles, representative schemes, characteristics, and potential applications of each mainstream type of piezoelectric actuator. Herein, we intend to provide a more scientific and nuanced perspective to classify piezoelectric actuators into direct and indirect categories with several subcategories. In addition, this review outlines the pros and cons and the future development trends for all kinds of piezoelectric actuators by exploring the relations and mechanisms behind them. The rich content and detailed comparison can help build an in-depth and holistic understanding of piezoelectric actuators and pave the way for future research and the selection of practical applications.",

The inherent properties of PEDOT:PSS are crucial to high-performance Sn-Pb perovskite films and devices; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully explored and revealed. Here, we report a facile oxalic acid treatment of PEDOT:PSS (OA-PEDOT:PSS) to precisely regulate its work function and surface morphology. OA-PEDOT:PSS shows a larger work function and an ordered reorientation and fiber-shaped film morphology with efficient hole transport pathways, leading to the formation of more ideal hole-selective contact with Sn-Pb perovskite for suppressing interfacial nonradiative recombination losses. Moreover, OA-PEDOT:PSS induces (100) preferred orientation growth of perovskite for higher-quality Sn-Pb films. Last, the OA-PEDOT:PSS\u2013tailored LBG PSC yields an impressive efficiency of up to 22.56% (certified 21.88%), enabling 27.81% efficient all-perovskite TSC with enhanced operational stability.",

Appropriate lighting in animal facilities may support welfare and ensure that animals enter experiments in an appropriate physiological and behavioral state. Furthermore, proper consideration of light during experimentation is important both when it is explicitly employed as an independent variable and as a general feature of the environment. This Consensus View discusses metrics to use for the quantification of light appropriate for nonhuman mammals and their application to improve animal welfare and the quality of animal research. It provides methods for measuring these metrics, practical guidance for their implementation in husbandry and experimentation, and quantitative guidance on appropriate light exposure for laboratory mammals. The guidance provided has the potential to improve data quality and contribute to reduction and refinement, helping to ensure more ethical animal use.",

However, its anticancer efficacy is impeded by low water solubility, dose-limiting toxicity, low bioavailability, and rapid hepatic metabolism. To overcome these hurdles, various nanoparticles such as organic and inorganic nanoparticles, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, solid lipid nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, zinc oxide nanoparticles, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, carbon nanotubes, bioactive glass nanoparticles, and mesoporous nanoparticles were employed to deliver resveratrol, enhancing its water solubility, bioavailability, and efficacy against various types of cancer. Resveratrol-loaded nanoparticle or resveratrol-conjugated nanoparticle administration exhibits excellent anticancer potency compared to free resveratrol.

Findings reveal that the evolutionary cycle of recent quantum technologies, based on patent data, is reducing compared to older technologies originated before 1980: from about 66 to 45 years. In addition, recent quantum technologies have a growth phase of about 22 years and maturity phase of 11 years, a shorter period than technologies originated before the 1980s (having a growth phase of 40 years and a maturity phase of about 13 years). The measure of entropy in the growth phase is lower (0.64) than maturity phase (0.74): a lower diversification of technological topics and technological trajectories.

Main body of abstract Nanotechnology with valuable advantages create possibilities to accelerate the efficacy of treatment. Compared to matrix-based formulations, drug nanocrystals (NCs) with smaller size, high drug loading, high active targeting, extended circulation, great structural stability, tailored dissolution, and being carrier free have sparked a lot of interest in drug delivery. Many hydrophobic drugs were explored as drug NCs such as\u2014doxorubicin, paclitaxel, campothecin and so on. However, premature leakage and clearance by mononuclear phagocytosis system lead to some great obstacles in the clinical applications of drug NCs. Conclusion In the recent years, strategies leading to surface modification are applied to improve uncontrolled drug release and targeting efficiency to tumor cells. The current review sheds light on various properties of drug nanocrystals, brief insights on its fabricating techniques, approaches for tumor targeting with NCs, and their applications in cancer imaging and therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, and early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing vision loss. This review aims to provide an overview of current diagnostic and treatment standards, recent medical and technological advances, and current challenges and future outlook for wearable glaucoma diagnostics and therapeutics. Conventional diagnostic techniques, including the rebound tonometer and Goldmann Applanation Tonometer, provide reliable intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement data at single-interval visits. The Sensimed Triggerfish and other emerging contact lenses provide continuous IOP tracking, which can improve diagnostic IOP monitoring for glaucoma. Conventional therapeutic techniques include eye drops and laser therapies, while emerging drug-eluting contact lenses can solve patient noncompliance with eye medications. Theranostic platforms combine diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities into a single device. Advantages of these platforms include real-time monitoring and personalized medication dosing. While there are many challenges to the development of wearable glaucoma diagnostics and therapeutics, wearable technologies hold great potential for enhancing glaucoma management by providing continuous monitoring, improving medication adherence, and reducing the disease burden on patients and healthcare systems. Further research and development of these technologies will be essential to optimizing patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Gallium and indium are crucial metals in various industries, such as the medical and telecommunication industries. They can find applications as pure metals, alloys and alloy admixtures, oxides, organometallic compounds, and compounds with elements such as nitrogen or arsenic. Recovery of these two metals from waste is an important issue for two main reasons. First, gallium and indium are scattered in the Earth\u2019s crust and their minerals are too rare to serve as a primary source. Second, e-waste contributes to the rapidly growing problem of Earth littering, as its amount increased significantly in recent years. Therefore, it is essential to develop and implement procedures that will enable the recovery of valuable elements from waste and limit the emission of harmful substances into the environment. This paper discusses technological operations and methods that are currently used or may be used to produce pure gallium and indium or their oxides from waste. The first step was described\u2014waste pretreatment, including disassembly and sorting in several stages. Then, mechanical treatment as well as physical, chemical, and physicochemical separations were discussed. The greatest emphasis was placed on the hydrometallurgical methods of gallium and indium recovery, to be more precise on the extraction and various sorption methods following the leaching stage. Methods of obtaining pure metals or metal oxides and their refining processes were also mentioned.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Research Summary Startups are increasingly turning to incumbent firms for venture capital, anticipating access to the investor's knowledge and complementary assets. However, startups' eventual access to these resources varies widely. This article highlights one important driver of such variance, whether startups' managers were previously employed by an incumbent in the same industry. Using data from the life sciences, I find that such corporate experience can precipitate technical knowledge flows to startups by enabling the generation of relational capital with incumbent firm managers. It also helps startups navigate incumbents' decision\u2010processes to formalize access to downstream complementary assets via alliances. The former effect is stronger when corporate experience is technology\u2010focused, the latter when it is commercialization\u2010focused. Corporate experience at the investing incumbent firm amplifies informal knowledge\u2010flows but not formal alliances. Managerial Summary Startups typically expect corporate venture capital investors to facilitate access to resources these investors' parent companies control. However, such resource\u2010access often does not materialize, with startups struggling to navigate the large, complex organizations within which these resources are located. I identify an important driver of variance in such resource\u2010access. Prior experience working in an established company in the same industry enhances startup leaders' ability to informally tap into corporate investors' technical knowledge, and to formalize alliances to access corporate investors' go\u2010to\u2010market assets. Technology\u2010focused experience is especially helpful with the former, and commercialization\u2010focused experience with the latter. Such access is more likely to enable exit for the startup if the established firm has direct experience in the specific product markets the startup is focusing on.",

        "abstract": "Current day x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) instrument makers have made significant advances in charge compensation systems over the last 20 years, which makes it easier to analyze insulators, but samples still have many differences in chemistry, dielectric properties, sizes, surface roughness, etc. that force instrument operators to tweak flood gun settings if they want or need to obtain high quality chemical state spectra that provide the most information. This guide teaches which flood gun variables to check, and how to optimize electron flood gun settings by presenting high energy resolution, chemical state spectra that show the result of using a poorly aligned flood gun on modern XPS instruments equipped with a monochromatic aluminum Kalpha x-ray source. This guide is focused on the XPS measurement of insulators\u2014nonconductive metal oxides and polymers. This guide shows that by measuring commonly available polymers (polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate) or ceramic materials (SiO2 and Al2O3), the operator can easily characterize the good and bad effects of XY position settings and other settings provided by modern electron flood gun systems. This guide includes many original, never-before-published XPS peak full width at half maximum (FWHM) that will greatly assist peak-fitting efforts. This guide reveals a direct correlation between electron count-rate and best charge-control settings. This guide discusses sample and instrument issues that affect surface charging and explains how to check the quality of charge control by measuring the FWHM and binding energy of C (1s) or O (1s) spectra produced from the sample currently being analyzed. A list of other charge-control methods is provided, along with advice and a best-known method. The availability of large extensive databases of actual spectra is extremely beneficial to users who need real-world examples of high quality chemical state spectra to guide their in-house efforts to collect high quality spectra and to interpret valuable information from the peak-fits of those spectra.",

Drawing on data between 2017 and 2023 and strategic decisions, such as bans and export controls directed at China\u2019s companies and the changing alignment posture of Western states, we employ the Balance of Threat (BoT) theory to examine China\u2019s changing aggregate power, offensive capabilities and aggressive intentions, while also establishing the vanishing importance of the geographic dimension. We then turn to the behavior of the US and Western states by drawing on the BoT theory, which suggests balancing as a prime strategy to counter the threat and identify instances of the formation of a balancing coalition against China. We demonstrate how the notion of threat in ETs can be approached and conclude with a characterization of balancing in the domain of ETs that resonates with the notion of \u201cgradual balancing\u201d, in addition to outlining suggestions for future studies.",

        "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing technologies are rapidly becoming an integral part of the advanced technological portfolio for the most demanding industrial applications. These processes are capable of fabricating three-dimensional components with near-net shape quality by depositing the constituent materials in a layer-by-layer fashion. This fabrication approach provides numerous advantages over conventional manufacturing methods, including enhanced design flexibility, reduced production costs and lead times, rapid prototyping, and the possibility to repair damaged parts. In recent years, the growing demand for novel accelerator components with improved performance characteristics, integrating structures such as drift tubes and internal cooling channels, has prompted the exploration of additive manufacturing in the field of particle accelerators. Radio-frequency components, beam intercepting devices, and vacuum systems have been prototyped using various metallic materials and additive manufacturing technologies, demonstrating performance levels comparable to the conventionally manufactured counterparts in preliminary tests. However, the absence of established qualification protocols and the uncertain reliability of additively manufactured parts under the demanding conditions typical of accelerator applications pose significant challenges to the integration of additive manufacturing processes into the fabrication practices of these components. This paper provides a comprehensive review of documented applications of metal additive manufacturing in particle accelerators, highlighting benefits, challenges, and opportunities for future improvements. The main requirements and currently available test setups for the assessment of additively manufactured components in applications involving ultrahigh vacuum and intense electromagnetic fields are also discussed.

        "abstract": "Abstract Nanosized drug crystals have been reported with enhanced apparent solubility, bioavailability, and therapeutic efficacy compared to microcrystal materials, which are not suitable for parenteral administration. However, nanocrystal design and development by bottom\u2010up approaches are challenging, especially considering the non\u2010standardized process parameters in the injection step. This work aims to present a systematic step\u2010by\u2010step approach through Quality\u2010by\u2010Design (QbD) and Design of Experiments (DoE) for synthesizing drug nanocrystals by a semi\u2010automated nanoprecipitation method. Curcumin is used as a drug model due to its well\u2010known poor water solubility (0.6 \u00b5g mL \u22121 , 25 \u00b0C). Formal and informal risk assessment tools allow identifying the critical factors. A fractional factorial 2 4\u22121 screening design evaluates their impact on the average size and polydispersity of nanocrystals. The optimization of significant factors is done by a Central Composite Design. This response surface methodology supports the rational design of the nanocrystals, identifying and exploring the design space. The proposed joint approach leads to a reproducible, robust, and stable nanocrystalline preparation of 316 nm with a PdI of 0.217 in compliance with the quality profile. An orthogonal approach for particle size and polydispersity characterization allows discarding the formation of aggregates. Overall, the synergy between advanced data analysis and semi\u2010automated standardized nanocrystallization of drugs is highlighted.",

        "abstract": "Integrated Motor Drives (IMDs) are gaining popularity in industrial Variable Speed Drive (VSD) applications, thanks to their more compact realization and simpler installation. However, mission profiles of, e.g., servo applications, demand overload torques of two to three times the nominal value during several seconds, which is thermally challenging for the power electronics. Accordingly, high efficiency and power density of the inverter are of paramount importance for motor integration. Multi-Level Flying Capacitor inverters (ML-FCis) benefit from a reduced output filter volume and improved switching and on-state performance of low-voltage devices for increasing number of levels N, whereas the PCB overhead and gate drive volume increases. In this paper, the most power dense solution between a seven-level (7L) FCi with Si semiconductors and a three-level (3L) FCi with GaN semiconductors is evaluated. Thereby, a straightforward design procedure allows to dimension both FCis for 99% efficiency at nominal operation, while providing a high short-term overload torque (three times the nominal torque) also for low inverter output frequencies. Due to its slightly higher power density and greatly reduced complexity, a phase module of the 3L GaN FCi is realized as an IMD hardware demonstrator. A transient thermal model is employed to specify the feasible overload operating range, considering the limited heat spreading in the baseplate and parameter variations, e.g., from manufacturing tolerances. The experimental analysis of the demonstrator verifies an efficiency of 98.94% and the practically required overload capability.",

        "abstract": "Batteries are essential in modern society as they can power a wide range of devices, from small household appliances to large-scale energy storage systems. Safety concerns with traditional lithium-ion batteries prompted the emergence of new battery technologies, among them solid-state batteries (SSBs), offering enhanced safety, energy density, and lifespan. This paper reviews current state-of-the-art SSB electrolyte and electrode materials, as well as global SSB market trends and key industry players. Solid-state electrolytes used in SSBs include inorganic solid electrolytes, organic solid polymer electrolytes, and solid composite electrolytes. Inorganic options like lithium aluminum titanium phosphate excel in ionic conductivity and thermal stability but exhibit mechanical fragility. Organic alternatives such as polyethylene oxide and polyvinylidene fluoride offer flexibility but possess lower ionic conductivity. Solid composite electrolytes combine the advantages of inorganic and organic materials, enhancing mechanical strength and ionic conductivity. While significant advances have been made for composite electrolytes, challenges remain for synthesis intricacies and material stability. Nuanced selection of these electrolytes is crucial for advancing resilient and high-performance SSBs. Furthermore, while global SSB production capacity is currently below 2 GWh, it is projected to grow with a &gt;118% compound annual growth rate by 2035, when the potential SSB market size will likely exceed 42 billion euros.",

Relying on information about product recalls, we first show that analyst coverage on average reduces product quality, particularly when managers face greater short-term pressure from institutional investors. However, after identifying a subgroup of analysts who raise questions on product-related issues in earnings conference calls, we find that coverage by these \u201cproduct analysts\u201d enhances rather than compromises product quality. Firms with greater product analyst coverage are also more likely to retire low-quality products. Additional analysis demonstrates that product analysts help safeguard product quality by further probing into product-related matters and issuing more timely recommendation downgrades after firms announce product deficiencies.

        "abstract": "In the first half of the twentieth century, scientific communities worldwide endeavored to diminish dependence on expensive and scarce animal fibers like wool and silk. Their efforts focused on developing regenerated protein fibers, including soy, zein, and casein, to provide comparable benefits to natural protein fibers, such as lustrous appearance, warmth, and a soft feel. The popularity and cost-effectiveness of mass-produced petroleum-based synthetic polymer fibers during World War II diminished interest in developing soy protein fiber. Realizing the ecological degradation caused by fossil fuels and their derived products, a renewed drive exists to explore bio-based waste materials like soy protein. As a fast-growing crop, soy provides abundant byproducts with opportunities for waste valorization. The soybean oil extraction process produces soy protein as a byproduct, which is a highly tunable biopolymer. Various functional groups within the soy protein structure enable it to acquire different valuable properties. This review critically examines scholarly publications addressing soy protein fiber developmental history, soy protein microstructure modification methods, and soy protein fiber spinning technologies. Additionally, we provide our scientific-based views relevant to overcoming the limitations of previous work and share prospects to make soy protein byproducts viable textile fibers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Industrial policy is back. After having been considered a taboo since the 1970s, \u201cnew industrial policies\u201d are at the core of governments\u2019 strategies to support countries during crises and enable the green and digital transitions. Virtually, every government has used and uses industrial policy, despite continued concerns related to anticompetitive effects, within and across countries, captured by vested interests and the opportunity cost of public funds, which economists have pointed out, based on previous unsuccessful experiences. In this paper, we contribute to the debate on industrial policy by presenting both a sound and simple framework to help design industrial policies and also data that allow the comparison of industrial strategies and their priorities across countries. First, this paper summarises our recent framework for industrial strategies, which is designed to offer practical policy advice and shed light on the complementarities between different policy instruments. Such a framework is particularly useful when designing complex mission-oriented industrial strategies promoting the green transition of the business sector. Second, this paper presents some salient results from the new \u201cQuantifying Industrial Strategies\u201d (QuIS) project, which gathers harmonised data on industrial policy expenditures, policy priorities, and policy instruments, thereby allowing the benchmarking of industrial strategies across countries. Based on the aforementioned conceptual framework, QuIS measures industrial policy expenditures across 9 OECD members, for the period 2019\u20132021. The data, now publicly available on the OECD website, show the importance of industrial policy expenditures, and the growing role of green industrial policies in countries industrial strategies.",

        "abstract": "The confluence of a large variety of factors, achievements and developments has resulted in the current long-term success in graft transplants. Some of these events are reviewed, paying special attention to immunosuppressant drugs, which are one of the most relevant milestones in the prevention of organ transplant rejection. The discovery, industrial exploitation, mechanisms of action and side effects of several drugs exhibiting immunosuppressive effects (e.g., corticosteroids, nitrogen mustards, mycophenolic acid, rapamycin) are deeply detailed. Furthermore, new trends in immunosuppressant research, improvement and reformulation are also reviewed. Nevertheless, the core of the manuscript is the immunosuppressant tacrolimus, also called FK506, which has been sought after due to the commercial success of cyclosporine and other immunosuppressant compounds, but also because of the side effects of those previous compounds. Thus, in the mid-1980s tacrolimus was described as a more potent immunosuppressive molecule, with less undesirable effects. Currently, tacrolimus is a well-stablished API that is used as a clinical treatment to avoid graft rejection, but also shows interesting properties in terms of decreasing the impact of some autoimmune diseases and acting as an enhancer of nerve regeneration treatments. Thus, in the 40th anniversary of its discovery, this paper describes the current state of the art of this drug and how it is adapting to new social needs and clinical trends.",

However, despite the notable growth in the number of green patents, China\u2019s green patent system still faces numerous challenges, particularly in terms of examination scope, examination standards, patent quality enhancement, and the participation of private entities. In addressing these challenges, China can draw on the valuable aspects of the green patent systems in the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and South Korea to gradually improve its own green patent system. In the future, China\u2019s green patent system should progressively shift its focus from the growth in patent quantity to the enhancement of patent quality, ensuring the depth of technological innovation and its market value. Only in this way can China better achieve its \u201cdual carbon goal\u201d and provide a viable \u201cChinese solution\u201d for global climate governance.",

Unlike prior studies that focused on patent titles or abstracts, this approach reveals the protected technical content driving commercialization. The study classifies innovations into seven domains: fuel storage, fuel delivery, fuel management, turbine enhancement, fuel cell integration, hybrid propulsion, and safety enhancement. Thematic word clouds and term co-occurrence networks based on natural language processing techniques validate these classifications and highlight core technical themes. Scientometric analyses uncover rapid patent growth, rising international participation, and strong engagement from both established aerospace firms and young companies. The findings provide stakeholders with a structured view of the innovation landscape, helping to identify technological gaps, emerging trends, and areas for strategic investment and policymaking.

The conundrum is that present designs of vehicles might be pure battery or could instead be hydrogen-fuel-cell-battery drive train, allowing much more onboard energy storage. The success of the lithium battery that started near 2008 has been extended in many countries, giving exponential rise in pure battery designs, but there are several snags that still need to be solved. In contrast, the hydrogen-fuel-cell-battery-electric-vehicle only became economically viable near 2018, giving a decade lag, but with numerous advantages such as low price, less weight, long range and rapid refuelling. The purpose of this paper is to outline key difficulties, mainly of infrastructure, before attempting to predict the future advances of both technologies.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are a widely used energy storage technology as they possess high energy density and are characterized by the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Li ions between electrodes. The rapid development of LIBs has led to increased production efficiency and lower costs for manufacturers, resulting in a growing demand for batteries and their application across various industries, particularly in different types of vehicles. In order to meet the demand for LIBs while minimizing climate-impacting emissions, the reuse, recycling, and repurposing of LIBs is a critical step toward achieving a sustainable battery economy. This paper provides a comprehensive review of lithium-ion battery recycling, covering topics such as current recycling technologies, technological advancements, policy gaps, design strategies, funding for pilot projects, and a comprehensive strategy for battery recycling. Additionally, this paper emphasizes the challenges associated with developing LIB recycling and the opportunities arising from these challenges, such as the potential for innovation and the creation of a more sustainable and circular economy. The environmental implications of LIB recycling are also evaluated with methodologies able to provide a sustainability analysis of the selected technology. This paper aims to enhance the comprehension of these trade-offs and encourage discussion on determining the \u201cbest\u201d recycling route when targets are in conflict.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The demand for 3D-printed high-performance polymers (HPPs) is on the rise across sectors such as the defense, aerospace, and automotive industries. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) exhibits exceptional mechanical performance, thermal stability, and wear resistance. Herein, six generic and device-independent control parameters, that is, the infill percentage, deposition angle, layer height, travel speed, nozzle temperature, and bed temperature, were quantitatively evaluated for their impact on multiple response metrics related to energy consumption and mechanical strength. The balance between energy consumption and mechanical strength was investigated for the first time, contributing to the sustainability of the PEI material in 3D printing. This is critical considering that HPPs require high temperatures to be built using the 3D printing method. PEI filaments were fabricated and utilized in material extrusion 3D printing of 125 specimens for 25 different experimental runs (five replicates per run). The divergent impacts of the control parameters on the response metrics throughout the experimental course have been reported. The real weight of the samples varies from 1.06 to 1.82 g (71%), the real printing time from 214 to 2841 s (~ 1300%), the ultimate tensile strength from 15.17 up to 80.73 MPa (530%), and the consumed energy from 0.094 to 1.44 MJ (1500%). The regression and reduced quadratic equations were validated through confirmation runs (10 additional specimens). These outcomes have excessive engineering and industrial merit in determining the optimum control parameters, ensuring the sustainability of the process, and the desired functionality of the products.

        "abstract": "Ceramic materials have obvious advantages in thermal stability, but impedance mismatch limits their ability to attenuate electromagnetic (EM) waves. Herein, a novel series of high-entropy (V0.2Nb0.2Zr0.2Ta0.2X0.2)B2 (X = Mo, Ti, and Hf) ceramics were successfully synthesized via ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) apparatus based on joule heating. The results indicated that the effect of high-entropy component on the magnetic loss of the system was relatively small, but the effect on the dielectric loss was larger. Among them, the (V0.2Nb0.2Zr0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2)B2 (HEB-Ti) sample demonstrated superior absorbing properties due to relatively moderate dielectric loss and optimal EM impedance matching. Moreover, because of its relatively moderate attenuation constant, it could achieve the maximum penetration of the EM wave and the minimum reflection after absorbing wave. As a result, the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) was as low as \u221240.7 dB, and the effective absorption band covered the entire low-frequency range from 2 to 8 GHz. Its excellent absorption performance was mainly due to the synergistic effect of various dielectric attenuation mechanisms, including defect polarization, dipole polarization, and conduction loss. Furthermore, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis showed that the sample exhibited excellent thermal stability and could withstand temperatures up to 550 \u00b0C in air and 1000 \u00b0C in an argon gas environment. The relevant work could provide meaningful references for the design of new high-performance ceramic wave-absorbing materials.",

        "title": "Broadening the Voltage Window of 3D-Printed MXene Micro-Supercapacitors with a Hybridized Electrolyte",
        "abstract": "The burgeoning demand for miniaturized energy storage devices compatible with the miniaturization trend of electronic technologies necessitates advancements in micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) that promise safety, cost efficiency, and high-speed charging capabilities. However, conventional aqueous MSCs face a significant limitation due to their inherently narrow electrochemical potential window, which restricts their operational voltage and energy density compared to their organic and ionic liquid counterparts. In this study, we introduce an innovative aqueous NaCl/H2O/EG hybrid gel electrolyte (comprising common salt (NaCl), H2O, ethylene glycol (EG), and SiO2) for Ti3C2Tx MXene MSCs that substantially widens the voltage window to 1.6 V, a notable improvement over traditional aqueous system. By integrating the hybrid electrolyte with 3D-printed MXene electrodes, we realized MSCs with remarkable areal capacitance (1.51 F cm\u22122) and energy density (675 \u00b5Wh cm\u22122), significantly surpassing existing benchmarks for aqueous MSCs. The strategic formulation of the hybrid electrolyte\u2014a low-concentration NaCl solution with EG\u2014ensures both economic and environmental viability while enabling enhanced electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the MSCs fabricated via 3D printing technology exhibit exceptional flexibility and are suitable for modular device integration, offering a promising avenue for the development of high-performance, sustainable energy storage devices. This advancement not only provides a tangible solution to the challenge of limited voltage windows in aqueous MXene MSCs but also sets a new precedent for the design of next-generation MSCs that align with the needs of an increasingly microdevice-centric world.",

        "title": "Mathematical Model for Assessing New, Non-Fossil Fuel Technological Products (Li-Ion Batteries and Electric Vehicle)",
        "abstract": "Since private cars and vans accounted for more than 25% of global oil consumption and about 10% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2022, increasing the share of electric vehicle (EV) ownership is considered an important solution for reducing CO2 emissions. At the same time, reducing emissions entails certain economic losses for those countries whose exports are largely covered by the oil trade. The explosive growth of the EV segment over the past 15 years has given rise to overly optimistic forecasts for global EV penetration by 2050. One of the major obstacles to such a development scenario is the limited availability of resources, especially critical materials. This paper proposes a mathematical model to predict the global EV fleet based on the limited availability of critical materials such as lithium, one of the key elements for battery production. The proposed model has three distinctive features. First, it shows that the classical logistic function, due to the specificity of its structure, cannot correctly describe market saturation in the case of using resources with limited serves. Second, even the use of a special multiplier that describes the market saturation process taking into account the depletion (finiteness) of the used resource does not obtain satisfactory economic results because of the \u201chigh speed\u201d depletion of this resource. Third, the analytical solution of the final model indicates the point in time at which changes in saturation rate occur. The latter situation allows us to determine the tracking of market saturation, which is more similar to the process that is actually occurring. We believe that this model can also be validated to estimate the production of wind turbines that use rare earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium (for the production of powerful and permanent magnets for wind turbines). These results also suggest the need for oil-exporting countries to technologically diversify their economies to minimize losses in the transition to a low-carbon economy.",

        "abstract": "Smelting used to be less efficient; therefore, wastes obtained from historical processing at smelter plants usually contain certain quantities of valuable metals. Upon the extraction of useful metal elements, metallurgical slag can be repurposed as an alternative mineral raw material in the building sector. A case study was conducted, which included an investigation of the physico-chemical, mineralogical, and microstructural properties of Pb\u2013Zn slag found at the historic landfill near the Topilnica Veles smelter in North Macedonia. The slag was sampled using drill holes. The mineralogical and microstructural analysis revealed that Pb\u2013Zn slag is a very complex and inhomogeneous alternative raw material with utilizable levels of metals, specifically Pb (2.3 wt.%), Zn (7.1 wt.%), and Ag (27.5 ppm). Crystalline mineral phases of wurtzite, sphalerite, galena, cerussite, akermanite, w\u00fcstite, monticellite, franklinite, and zincite were identified in the analyzed samples. The slag\u2019s matrix consisted of alumino-silicates, amorphous silicates, and mixtures of spinel and silicates. Due to the economic potential of Pb, Zn, and Ag extraction, the first stage of reutilization will be to transform metal concentrates into their collective concentrate, from which the maximum amount of these crucial components can be extracted. This procedure will include combination of gravity concentration and separation techniques. The next step is to assess the Pb\u2013Zn slag\u2019s potential applications in civil engineering, based on its mineralogical and physico-mechanical properties. Alumino-silicates present in Pb\u2013Zn slag, which contain high concentrations of SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, and Fe2O3, are suitable for use in cementitious building composites. The goal of this research is to suggest a solution by which to close the circle of slag\u2019s reutilization in terms of zero waste principles. It is therefore critical to thoroughly investigate the material, the established methods and preparation processes, and the ways of concentrating useful components into commercial products.",

This review explores the convergence of sustainable AM practices with the industrial landscape of Africa, highlighting potential benefits and challenges. Through efficient resource utilization and localized production capabilities, AM holds promise for enhancing industrial resilience, stimulating employment opportunities, and fostering innovation. However, the realization of these benefits necessitates navigating infrastructural limitations, technological disparities, and regulatory complexities. By critically examining sustainable AM strategies and their relevance to African contexts, this review aims to delineate actionable pathways for leveraging the transformative potential of AM. The role of AM in industrialization as expressed in the African Union Agenda 2063 are highlighted. This has the potential to increase the staggering \u223c11% contribution of manufacturing to gross domestic product of Africa. Collaboration through the triple helix approach focusing on government, industry and academia is highly pivotal for the success of such nascent and ubiquitous AM technology which is able to address the sustainable development goals. Africa can leapfrog and harness sustainable AM as a catalyst for inclusive industrial development and sustainable growth across the continent. The implications of AM for an industrialised Africa and areas for future research direction are briefly discussed.",

In this work, a novel approach to the waste valorization of cuttlebone was investigated. This material was ground and calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h in an inert atmosphere. The resulting calcined cuttlebone (CCB) was characterized using XRD, SEM, FTIR, BET, TGA, Zetasizer, and potential methods. The main phases in the CCB were determined to be CaO, MgO, Ca3(PO4)2, and residual carbon. CCB was investigated as an adsorbent for the removal of dye from simulated wastewater streams. The maximum adsorption capacities for rhodamine B and crystal violet dyes were estimated to be 519 and 921 mg/g, respectively. For both dyes, the Avrami model was the best-fit model for representing adsorption kinetics. The study of adsorbent regeneration for CV as a representative example involved the use of several chemical solvents. Ethanol solvent was shown to have the highest adsorbent regeneration method efficiency, reaching 65.20%. In addition, CCB was investigated for methanol electro-oxidation for energy generation. As the methanol concentration increased, the maximum current density produced by the CCB increased, reaching approximately 50 mA/cm2.

The nose, leading edges, and some elements of the engine typically require the implementation of highly refractory materials or an active thermal protection system to maintain structural stability during the vehicle mission. Carbon\u2013carbon (C\u2013C) composites are commonly considered for the application thanks to their unique thermal and mechanical properties. However, C\u2013C composites\u2019 ablation and oxidation under long cruise flights at high speeds (Mach number &gt; 5) are the limiting factors for their application. In this paper, the results of an experimental study of C\u2013C composite thermal ablation and oxidation with test article surface temperatures up to 2000 K are presented. The tests were performed under atmospheric conditions and hypersonic flow in the ND_ArcJet facility at the University of Notre Dame. The test articles were preheated with CW laser radiation and then exposed to M = 6 flow at stagnation pressures up to 14 bar. It was found that C\u2013C composite oxidation and mechanical erosion rates are significantly increased in hypersonic airflow compared to those at ambient conditions and nitrogen M = 6 flow. Compared to atmospheric air, mass loss occurred at a rate of 1.5 orders of magnitude faster for M = 6 airflow. During high-speed flow conditions, rapid chemical oxidation and the mechanical destruction of weakened C-fibers likely cause the accelerated degradation of C\u2013C composite material. In this study, a post-mortem microscopic analysis of the morphology of the C\u2013C surface is used to explain the physical processes of the material destruction.",

This method offers a very fast and cost-effective alternative for complete via filling without voids compared to the conventional metallization techniques such as electroplating or sputtering.

        "abstract": "Abstract Zirconium oxide-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte fuel cells were synthesized via heat treatment of zirconium polyacrylate in an NH 3 atmosphere. The effects of gas atmosphere and heat treatment temperature on the material structure were systematically examined. The formation of zirconium oxide nanoparticles and carbon residues, which act as electron conduction paths, was observed in all samples. The structure of the material varied significantly depending on the heat treatment conditions. The samples heat-treated in the NH 3 atmosphere showed greater exposure to zirconium oxide nanoparticles and an increase in the specific surface area of the carbon residue caused by NH 3 -induced etching. In addition, the conductivity of the carbon residue increased, and its quantity decreased with increasing heat treatment temperature. This trade-off was optimally controlled at 800 \u00b0C, which resulted in a high rest potential and a large ORR current density. This study demonstrates that the heat treatment of organometallic complexes in an NH 3 atmosphere is highly effective for exposing metal oxide nanoparticles and increasing the specific surface area of the carbon residue, providing valuable insights into the design of electron conduction paths for metal oxide-based catalysts.

        "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> This paper represents a high-thermal-insulation microreactor that enables the integration of standard planar-type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for portable power generation. While planar SOFCs offer high efficiency and energy density, their use has been largely limited to stationary applications due to challenges in thermal management and slow start-up times. Our microreactor overcomes these barriers by providing an effective thermal insulation system, allowing SOFCs to operate efficiently in a compact, portable format. We designed a cantileveredstructure using yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) to minimize thermal conduction and combined it with a multilayer insulation (MLI) system to suppress thermal radiation loss. This flexible cantileveredstructure prevents cracking under thermal stress and maintains high temperatures up to 700\u00b0C, ensuring reliable operation. Additionally, the MLI system features an inherent safety mechanism: when the insulation structure is damaged by a drilling, the loss of thermal insulation causes a rapid temperature drop, bringing the system below the hydrogen explosion threshold temperature within 5 minutes, thus preventing potential hazards. Our prototype successfully demonstrated handheld power generation using a planar metal-supported SOFC, achieving a rapid start-up time of just 5 minutes and driving a motor. This breakthrough offers a new platform for miniaturized SOFC technology, bridging the gap between stationary and portable energy solutions.",

        "abstract": "The Intelligent Manufacturing for Extreme Environments (IMEE) workshop was held at the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) in Idaho Falls, Idaho, May 2\u20133, 2023, in support of the United States (U.S.) National Science Foundation (NSF) Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research: Workshop Opportunities (EPSCoR-WO) program. This workshop featured keynote speakers, panels, and breakout sessions with 58 participants. Nuclear reactors need to operate under extreme service conditions, such as high temperatures, corrosive environments, and high-radiation doses. Hence, reactor components must be able to withstand those conditions. The participants envision a future where on demand manufacture of components for small modular reactors (SMRs), microreactors, and other advanced reactor designs are possible. In this future, regulatory bodies accept validated manufacturing processes and standardized feedstocks, thus eliminating the need for individual component testing. However, the necessary technologies and regulatory policies needed for this future do not exist today. Successful innovation would revolutionize the nuclear power sector, enable fast commercial development, create economic opportunities in the U.S., reduce the carbon footprint and associated risks, and promote a skilled and highly competitive workforce. The objective of the workshop was to convene world-class experts, researchers, educators, and students to identify gaps and envision solutions for five interrelated challenges for intelligent manufacturing in extreme environments. The key outcomes of the conference were: (1) to take the opportunity for researchers and educators to network and form collaborations; and (2) to produce a full report to inform policy-makers, industry, and the academic community of various challenges and opportunities in the nuclear energy sector.",

In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were used as the matrix, and a PVA/PEG/rare earth composite hydrogel material with controllable photoluminescence color was successfully developed by incorporating rare earth ion doping. Through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and fluorescence spectroscopy, it was confirmed that the introduction of lanthanide metal light-emitting units makes the material\u2019s photoluminescence color adjustable from red to green, significantly improves the mechanical properties, and the compressive strength is increased from 17.6 MPa to 23 MPa, representing a 30.7% improvement. In addition, the material exhibits excellent alkaline pH response characteristics; as the concentration of NaOH solution increases, the luminous intensity gradually decays to complete quenching. Based on the adjustable light color and dynamic response characteristics, the material can realize information concealment and encryption through programmable light color changes, providing a new functional material solution for intelligent anti-counterfeiting and optical encryption.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Amine-grafted adsorbents are promising CO 2 adsorbents; however, the excessive addition of an amino silane coupling agent during their synthesis increases their production cost. Thus, using low amounts of silane, we synthesized 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)-grafted SBA-15 mesoporous silica and evaluated its CO 2 adsorption performance. APTMS-grafted SBA-15 samples were prepared using either impregnation or heating\u2013filtration method (grafting). The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N 2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscopy, magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and elemental analysis. The results revealed that the micropores of SBA-15 were preferentially blocked, and APTMS increasingly occupied the mesopores with increasing amine loading. The CO 2 -adsorption performance of the adsorbents was measured by thermogravimetric analysis under dry conditions. Both synthesis methods achieved high amine immobilization efficiency (78.3\u201392.2%), as estimated from the amount of silane coupling agents used in the synthesis and that immobilized on the support. The adsorbents prepared by the two methods adsorbed similar amounts of CO 2 of approximately 0.5 mmol g \u2212 1 in 400 ppm CO 2 and ~ 1.0 mmol g \u2212 1 in 5 vol% CO 2 . The adsorption amounts attained in this study are comparable to those of previously reported silane-coupling-agent-modified adsorbents that were prepared with more silane. In contrast, the adsorption rate of the samples was affected by the synthesis method, even with similar amine loadings. Nonetheless, the results revealed that even with a low amount of the silane coupling agent, high-performance amine-grafted CO 2 adsorbents could be synthesized.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The properties of metal\u2010centred species in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions substantially influence the formation and evolution of colloidal particles, which in turn dictate the crystallisation process and the film quality. In this work, we assess the \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Lewis acid characteristics of Sn 2+ and Pb 2+ cations as a strategy to modulate the chemical environment of these metal\u2010containing species in mixed\u2010metal tin\u2013lead perovskite precursor solutions. We observe enhanced simultaneous access to both metal centres upon adding compounds with functional groups suggested by the hard\u2013soft acid\u2013base principle. Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn 2+ \u2010based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb 2+ \u2010based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi\u2010Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95 eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180 h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 \u00b0C, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In the deactivation of spent lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) by crushing in water for small\u2010scale recycling, one of the most difficult challenges is the treatment of wastewater containing LiPF 6 due to the slow decomposition rate of PF 6 \u2212 . Additionally, the recovery of dissolved Li + in wastewater is required. This study aims to separate PF 6 \u2212 and Li + from wastewater containing LiPF 6 by electrodialysis. LiPF 6 solution is prepared as the feed, and PF 6 \u2212 and Li + are transferred into the anolyte and catholyte through an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation exchange membrane (CEM), respectively. The transport numbers of PF 6 \u2212 and Li + in the AEM and CEM are measured as 0.22\u20130.32 and 0.22\u20130.50, respectively. Then, the effects of the compounds derived from LIBs electrolyte, ethylene glycol, and formic acid on the electrodialysis are investigated. In addition, the transport chemistry of LiPF 6 is discussed by comparing the electrodialysis of LiPF 6 with that of NaCl. The higher permselectivity of PF 6 \u2212 in the AEM is explained by the hydrophobicity of anions. Finally, the operation costs of wastewater treatment are estimated. This estimation suggests that electrodialysis has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of wastewater treatment.",

Unfortunately, existing epidermal ionic skins are not compliant and durable enough to accommodate the time-varying deformations of convoluted skin surface, due to an imbalance in viscosity and elasticity. Here we introduce a self-compliant ionic skin that consistently works at the critical gel point state with almost equal viscosity and elasticity over a super-wide frequency range. The material is designed by leveraging hierarchical hydrogen bond association, allowing for the continuous release of polymer strands to create topological entanglements as complementary crosslinks. By embodying properties of rapid stress relaxation, softness, ionic conductivity, self-healability, flaw-insensitivity, self-adhesion, and water-resistance, this ionic skin fosters excellent interfacial compliance with cyclically deforming substrates, and facilitates the acquisition of high-fidelity electrophysiological signals with alleviated motion artifacts. The presented strategy is generalizable and could expand the applicability of epidermal ionic skins to more complex service conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous structures emerging as promising electrode materials due to their high structural diversity, controlled and wide pore network, and amenability to chemical modifications. COFs are solely composed of periodically arranged organic molecules, resulting in lightweight materials. Their inherent properties, such as extended surface area and diverse framework topologies, along with their high proclivity to chemical modification, have positioned COFs as sophisticated materials in the realm of electrochemical energy storage (EES). The modular structure of COFs facilitates the integration of key functions such as redox\u2010active moieties, fast charge diffusion channels, composite formation with conductive counterparts, and highly porous network for accommodating charged energy carriers, which can significantly enhance their electrochemical performance. However, ascribing intricate porosity and redox\u2010active functionalities to a single COF structure, while maintaining long\u2010term electrochemical stability, is challenging. Efforts to overcome these hurdles embrace strategies such as the implementation of reversible linkages for structural flexibility, stimuli\u2010responsive functionalities, and incorporating chemical groups to promote the formation of COF heterostructures. This review focuses on the recent progress of COFs in EES devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, through a meticulous exploration of the latest strategies aimed at optimizing COFs as advanced electrodes in future EES technologies.",

        "abstract": "In academic research, OLEDs have exhibited rapid evolution thanks to the development of innovative materials, new device architectures, and optimized fabrication methods, achieving high performance in recent years. The numerous advantages that increasingly distinguish them from traditional light sources, such as a large and customizable emission area, color tunability, flexibility, and transparency, have positioned them as a promising candidate for various applications in the lighting market, including the residential, automotive, industrial, and agricultural sectors. However, despite these promising attributes, the widespread industrial production of OLEDs encounters significant challenges. Key considerations center around efficiency and lifetime. In the present review, after introducing the theoretical basis of OLEDs and summarizing the main performance developments in the industrial field, three crucial aspects enabling OLEDs to establish a competitive advantage in terms of performance and versatility are critically discussed: the quality and stability of the emitted light, with a specific focus on white light and its tunability; the transparency of both electrodes for the development of fully transparent and integrable devices; and the uniformity of emission over a large area.",

        "abstract": "This review focuses on the promising technology of solid-state batteries (SSBs) that utilize lithium metal and solid electrolytes. SSBs offer significant advantages in terms of high energy density and enhanced safety. This review categorizes solid electrolytes into four classes: polymer, oxide, hybrid, and sulfide solid electrolytes. Each class has its own unique characteristics and benefits. By exploring these different classes, this review aims to shed light on the diversity of materials and their contributions to the advancement of SSB technology. In order to gain insights into the latest technological developments and identify potential avenues for accelerating the progress of SSBs, this review examines the intellectual property landscape related to solid electrolytes. Thus, this review focuses on the recent SSB technology patent filed by the main companies in this area, chosen based on their contribution and influence in the field of batteries. The analysis of the patent application was performed through the Espacenet database. The number of patents related to SSBs from Toyota, Samsung, and LG is very important; they represent more than 3400 patents, the equivalent of 2/3 of the world\u2019s patent production in the field of SSBs. In addition to focusing on these three famous companies, we also focused on 15 other companies by analyzing a hundred patents. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the strategies employed by various companies in the field of solid-state battery technologies, bridging the gap between applied and academic research. Some of the technologies presented in this review have already been commercialized and, certainly, an acceleration in SSB industrialization will be seen in the years to come.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Measuring the impacts of collaborative projects between industry and academia raises significant challenges. It involves stakeholders with different outlooks and impact expectations. Moreover, the multidimensional nature of the impacts themselves means they are tangible and intangible, short- and long-term, direct and indirect, positive and negative, making their measurement process very complex. To gain a deeper understanding of how university-industry R&amp;D collaborations (UICs) impact society, this study conducts a systematic review, using thematic analysis of 92 selected articles published between 2000 and 2022. The paper identifies and categorizes the impacts resulting from UICs, examines the challenges associated with measuring these impacts, and explores the strategies that can be employed to overcome such challenges. Finally, the paper integrates all such findings into a comprehensive framework. This study contributes to the theoretical advancement of impact measurement within the field of UICs, providing a foundation for the development of methodologies aimed at assessing impacts. Furthermore, it highlights important avenues for future research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The 2002 SARS outbreak, the 2019 emergence of COVID-19, and the continuing evolution of immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants together highlight the need for a broadly protective vaccine against ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses. While updated variant-matched formulations are a step in the right direction, protection needs to extend beyond SARS-CoV-2 and its variants to include SARS-like viruses. Here, we introduce bivalent and trivalent vaccine formulations using our spike protein nanoparticle platform that completely protect female hamsters against BA.5 and XBB.1 challenges with no detectable virus in the lungs. The trivalent cocktails elicit highly neutralizing responses against all tested Omicron variants and the bat sarbecoviruses SHC014 and WIV1. Finally, our 614D/SHC014/XBB trivalent spike formulation completely protects human ACE2-transgenic female hamsters against challenges with WIV1 and SHC014 with no detectable virus in the lungs. Collectively, these results illustrate that our trivalent protein-nanoparticle cocktail can provide broad protection against SARS-CoV-2-like and SARS-CoV-1-like sarbecoviruses.",

It is estimated that 40%\u201345% of all process steps needed to manufacture semiconductor devices use LTPs in one form or another. LTPs have been an enabling technology in the multidecade progression of the shrinking of device dimensions, often referred to as Moore\u2019s law. New challenges in circuit and device design, novel materials, and increasing demands to achieve environmentally benign processing technologies require advances in plasma technology beyond the current state-of-the-art. The Department of Energy Office of Science Fusion Energy Sciences held a workshop titled Plasma Science for Microelectronics Nanofabrication in August 2022 to discuss the plasma science challenges and technical barriers that need to be overcome to continue to develop the innovative plasma technologies required to support and advance the semiconductor industry. One of the key outcomes of the workshop was identifying a set of priority research opportunities (PROs) to focus attention on the most strategic plasma science challenges to address to benefit the semiconductor industry. For each PRO, scientific challenges and recommended strategies to address those challenges were identified. This article summarizes the PROs identified by the workshop participants.",

Firstly, various marine renewable energy resources and state-of-art technologies for energy exploitation and storage were reviewed. The site selection criteria for each energy-harvesting approach were identified, and a scoring matrix for site selection was proposed to screen suitable locations for the hybrid system. The Triton Knoll wind farm was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scoring matrix. An integrated energy system was designed, and FE modeling was performed to assess the effects of additional energy devices on the structural stability of the main wind turbine structure. It has been proven that the additional energy structures have a negligible influence on foundation/structure deflection (&lt;1%) and increased system natural frequency by 6%; thus, they have a minimum influence on the original wind system but increased energy yield.",

        "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing technologies are rapidly becoming an integral part of the advanced technological portfolio for the most demanding industrial applications. These processes are capable of fabricating three-dimensional components with near-net shape quality by depositing the constituent materials in a layer-by-layer fashion. This fabrication approach provides numerous advantages over conventional manufacturing methods, including enhanced design flexibility, reduced production costs and lead times, rapid prototyping, and the possibility to repair damaged parts. In recent years, the growing demand for novel accelerator components with improved performance characteristics, integrating structures such as drift tubes and internal cooling channels, has prompted the exploration of additive manufacturing in the field of particle accelerators. Radio-frequency components, beam intercepting devices, and vacuum systems have been prototyped using various metallic materials and additive manufacturing technologies, demonstrating performance levels comparable to the conventionally manufactured counterparts in preliminary tests. However, the absence of established qualification protocols and the uncertain reliability of additively manufactured parts under the demanding conditions typical of accelerator applications pose significant challenges to the integration of additive manufacturing processes into the fabrication practices of these components. This paper provides a comprehensive review of documented applications of metal additive manufacturing in particle accelerators, highlighting benefits, challenges, and opportunities for future improvements. The main requirements and currently available test setups for the assessment of additively manufactured components in applications involving ultrahigh vacuum and intense electromagnetic fields are also discussed.

        "abstract": "Abstract Digital transformation and the possibility to collect large amount of data, the so-called big data, from different sources can lead to the redefinition of business processes, models and infrastructures. In this respect, data-driven decision making (DDDM) emphasizes the need to rethink management practices to view data as a driving force that can improve the effectiveness of decisions and nurture innovation. Over time, data-driven principles have been reframed as the foundations for the development of a new mind-set that considers data as a key asset that redesigns entrepreneurship and encompasses orientation, culture and human resources management to help entrepreneurs catch, evaluate and launch entrepreneurial opportunities that can improve technology and knowledge by stimulating innovation. For this reason, the study aims at reconceptualizing entrepreneurship according to a multi-levelled perspective based on the integration of cultural, human, knowledge-based and technological dimension to assess the impact of data-driven management on entrepreneurial opportunities creation and on the development of different kinds of innovation. To assess these goals, empirical research based on constructivist grounded theory and on the administration of semi-structured interviews is performed through the investigation of an Italian public\u2013private Consortium specialized in big data. The findings allow the elaboration of a conceptual framework which classifies the activities of data-driven entrepreneurial processes, the phases of opportunity creation and the different kinds of innovation enabled in the Consortium by guiding entrepreneurs and managers in the elaboration of effective data analysis strategies.",

        "title": "Enabling regulatory policy globally will promote realization of the potential of animal biotechnology",
        "abstract": "Abstract Animal biotechnologies have the potential to improve the sustainability and security of our global food systems. Government regulatory authorities are responsible for ensuring the safety of food their citizens consume, whether it is produced via conventional breeding methods or biotechnologies. While some countries have implemented animal biotechnology oversight policies, many countries have yet to develop theirs. Historically, regulatory approvals were required before products of biotechnology could enter the marketplace, and the high cost of the approval process limited the number and types of animal and plant products that sought approval. Only one biotech animal in the world that was developed for food production has reached the market under a GMO or rDNA approval process. The advent of genome editing techniques has revolutionized the scientific approach to introducing changes into DNA sequences and how biotechnology can be used to enhance agricultural breeding. Regulatory dialogs about biotechnology also have changed as a result of these new technologies. Regulatory agencies have begun to respond to these scientific advances, and a growing number of countries are looking to modernize regulatory approaches for these products, based on risk (or lack thereof) and similarity to organisms that could be produced via conventional breeding methods. Advances in animal biotechnology, especially genome editing, can accelerate the incorporation of valued phenotypes in animals, including enhanced yield, disease resistance, resilience to changing climate, and improved animal welfare, as well as food qualities valued by consumers. For animals with these biotechnology-introduced traits to enter agricultural production and reach consumers, clear risk-proportionate regulatory approaches must be in place, and to facilitate international trade of animal products, regulatory processes need to be aligned and compatible. Effective scientific public communication is crucial to build public trust in precision animal biotechnology and risk-proportionate regulatory approaches. An international workshop on regulatory approaches for animal biotechnology was convened in 2022 with 27 countries represented. We synthesize here technical progress, development of regulatory policy, and strategies for engagement with diverse publics on animal biotechnology reported in the workshop. Our goal is to encourage development and implementation of risk-proportionate regulatory approaches and policies in a global context.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of manufacturing sector has created a platform for implementing novel technologies such as additive manufacturing (AM). AM or 3D printing, has generated a lot of interests in biomedical applications during the last decade with a variety of novel printed polymeric materials. 3D printing fabricates 3D object with layer-by-layer processing through computer-controlled programming software. It has innumerable applications including electronics, aerospace engineering, automobile industry, architecture and medical sectors. One of the most demanding sectors of 3D printing is biomedical engineering applications such as medicines, drug delivery system, surgical instruments, orthopedics, scaffolds, implants etc. The clinical ramifications of AM-made healthcare goods are being catalyzed by recent developments in biomaterials. This review paper aims to explain the concept of 3D printing and its significance in developing polymeric materials for biomedical applications. An inclusive survey has been conducted on the various techniques involved in printing the biomedical devices. The proper selection of polymeric materials is important for biomedical applications, especially from 3D printing point of view and this vital parameter has been considered in this review paper. According to our findings, more breakthroughs in biomaterials, are required for the success and expansion of AM technology in the biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) represent the largest class of materials among crystalline porous materials ever developed, and have attracted attention as core materials for separation technology. Their extremely uniform pore aperture and nearly unlimited structural and chemical characteristics have attracted great interest and promise for applying MOFs to adsorptive and membrane-based separations. This paper reviews the recent research into and development of MOF membranes for gas separation. Strategies for polycrystalline membranes and mixed-matrix membranes are discussed, with a focus on separation systems involving hydrocarbon separation, CO2 capture, and H2 purification. Challenges to and opportunities for the industrial deployment of MOF membranes are also discussed, providing guidance for the design and fabrication of future high-performance membranes. The contributions of the underlying mechanism to separation performance and adopted strategies and membrane-processing technologies for breaking the selectivity/permeability trade-off are discussed.",

        "title": "Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0",
        "abstract": "In 1956, Kenneth Boulding explained the concept of General Systems Theory as a skeleton of science.He describes that it hopes to develop something like a \"spectrum\" of theories-a system of systems which may perform the function of a \"gestalt\" in theoretical construction.Such \"gestalts\" in special fields have been of great value in directing research towards the gaps which they reveal.There were, at that time, other important conceptual frameworks and theories, such as cybernetics.Additional theories and applications developed later, including synergetics, cognitive science, complex adaptive systems, and many others.Some focused on principles within specific domains of knowledge and others crossed areas of knowledge and practice, along the spectrum described by Boulding.Also in 1956, the Society for General Systems Research (now the International Society for the Systems Sciences) was founded.One of the concerns of the founders, even then, was the state of the human condition, and what science could do about it.The present Translational Systems Sciences book series aims at cultivating a new frontier of systems sciences for contributing to the need for practical applications that benefit people.The concept of translational research originally comes from medical science for enhancing human health and well-being.Translational medical research is often labeled as \"Bench to Bedside.\"It places emphasis on translating the findings in basic research (at bench) more quickly and efficiently into medical practice (at bedside).At the same time, needs and demands from practice drive the development of new and innovative ideas and concepts.In this tightly coupled process it is essential to remove barriers to multi-disciplinary collaboration.The present series attempts to bridge and integrate basic research founded in systems concepts, logic, theories and models with systems practices and methodologies, into a process of systems research.Since both bench and bedside involve diverse stakeholder groups, including researchers, practitioners and users, translational systems science works to create common platforms for language to activate the \"bench to bedside\" cycle.In order to create a resilient and sustainable society in the twenty-first century, we unquestionably need open social innovation through which we create new social values, and realize them in society by connecting diverse ideas and developing new solutions.We assume three types of social values, namely: (1) values relevant to social infrastructure such as safety, security, and amenity; (2) values created by innovation in business, economics, and management practices; and, (3) values necessary for community sustainability brought about by conflict resolution and consensus building.The series will first approach these social values from a systems science perspective by drawing on a range of disciplines in trans-disciplinary and cross-cultural ways.They may include social systems theory, sociology, business administration, management information science, organization science, computational mathematical organization theory, economics, evolutionary economics, international political science, jurisprudence, policy science, socioinformation studies, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, complex adaptive systems theory, philosophy of science, and other related disciplines.In addition, this series will promote translational systems science as a means of scientific research that facilitates the translation of findings from basic science to practical applications, and vice versa.We believe that this book series should advance a new frontier in systems sciences by presenting theoretical and conceptual frameworks, as well as theories for design and application, for twenty-first-century socioeconomic systems in a translational and trans-disciplinary context.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The notion that society should be organized around large so-called missions has gained momentum in public debate, and the reemergence of active industrial policy across the world has been inspired by academic scholars promoting the idea of mission-oriented innovation policies (MOIPs). Besides this introductory chapter, this collective volume consists of 16 chapters distributed across 3 overarching themes: theoretical perspectives, empirical evidence, and alternative paths. The volume provides a comprehensive assessment and normative critique of the efficacy of such policies. In addition to summing up the main findings in the 16 chapters, this introduction provides some additional analysis, pins down the most important general conclusions, and suggests future research questions. Today\u2019s economies are highly dependent on a well-functioning process of decentralized experimentation, selection, and screening. Instead of large-scale MOIPs, governments should strive to create an institutional framework that levels the playing field for potential entrepreneurs while encouraging productive entrepreneurship.",

        "abstract": "Musculoskeletal injuries such as equine osteoarthritis, osteoarticular defects, tendonitis/desmitis, and muscular disorders are prevalent among sport horses, with a fair prognosis for returning to exercise or previous performance levels. The field of equine medicine has witnessed rapid and fruitful development, resulting in a diverse range of therapeutic options for musculoskeletal problems. Staying abreast of these advancements can be challenging, prompting the need for a comprehensive review of commonly used and recent treatments. The aim is to compile current therapeutic options for managing these injuries, spanning from simple to complex physiotherapy techniques, conservative treatments including steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hyaluronic acid, polysulfated glycosaminoglycans, pentosan polysulfate, and polyacrylamides, to promising regenerative therapies such as hemoderivatives and stem cell-based therapies. Each therapeutic modality is scrutinized for its benefits, limitations, and potential synergistic actions to facilitate their most effective application for the intended healing/regeneration of the injured tissue/organ and subsequent patient recovery. While stem cell-based therapies have emerged as particularly promising for equine musculoskeletal injuries, a multidisciplinary approach is underscored throughout the discussion, emphasizing the importance of considering various therapeutic modalities in tandem.",

This paper adopts a mixed-method policy inventory and analysis to examine the rise of the new energy vehicle (NEV) industry in China\u2019s Greater Bay Area. It also systematically analyses the policies implemented by the central government, province, and cities in building a sustainable regional industry. A core dilemma is that cities are competing with one another for NEV development, yet regional industrial development requires coordination and cooperation. Examining the four policy areas of production, consumption, infrastructure support, and pollution suppression reveals that the competition among cities can be a driving force for the adoption of sustainable technology when supported by regional policy coordination.",
